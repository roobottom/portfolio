Last night I attended a dinner event hosted by inVission as part of their [design leaders forum](https://www.invisionapp.com/design-leadership-forum/) series of events. Recent cultural difficulties on my team meant this was a welcome time of discussion with peers, many of whom had been experiencing similar problems of their own.

Compared by [Andy Budd](http://andybudd.com/) the evening brought together design leaders from in-and-around London to discuss the big issues facing their teams. Eased in with some gin tasting, the conversation was soon flowing around the room. Andy introduced the theme: hiring and retaining great talent; he kicked us off with the first question: 

## "What does great design culture look like?"

This was a timely question given we've been experiencing somewhat of an upheaval in the design and wider product and technology teams at Firefly over the last few months. 

This — _I think_ — comes as a result of failing to plan a team structure that scales. When a product-delivery[^1] team is small and is close to the business, it's easy for everyone to align on shared goals. Roadmap decisions can be made in the layer above the teams doing the work as communication is easy, and everyone is aware of context and everyone else's needs.

Scale this up and you loose that context. Suddenly management and product-delivery are separated by the size of the organisation and if the product roadmap is still being defined by the management layer then its being done so in a black-box fashion; abstracted from the product-delivery team, the very people who have the domain knowledge necessarily to make the right decisions about what to work on next. 

The solution to this is deceptively simple[^2]: **Feed business goals, context and data into teams and let them decide how best to meet those needs.**

## Insights from my peers

Thinking back our evening's discussions, the salient points to come from our table were:

* Decentralised design is working. Embedding designers into small, cross functional teams[^3] is enabling teams to discover and deliver product features that are genuinely useful.
* There's a blurry edge that exists between product and design; product is increasingly fulfilling the role traditionally covered by design.
* In order for designers to feel fulfilled there needs to be a clear definition of success.
* Not all designers see management as a desirable career path, we need to reward progress in other ways.

It seems to me that if you want design to succeed in a world where product decisions are being made by small, empowered teams then you absolutely need to embed designers into those teams.
