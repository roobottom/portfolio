## A pleasurable reading experience

Communication *via* the written word is one of life's great pleasures. Therefore, it's essential that the reading experience on this site is delightful. Good typography is crucial and should be considered first in all designs.

## Hand-drawn

Simple hand-drawn illustrations should be used to communicate ideas more effectively. Drawings don't have to be perfect, but they should be working hard to tell a story beyond the words they support.

## Straightforward to build

Making design decisions for ease of development means compromise. It means finding the sweet spot between the fine-grain control that a design tool like Sketch affords versus the limitations of HTML and CSS.

## Reuse, reuse, reuse

I'm a great believer in reusing components to do more than one job. You can use this site with the smallest set of ingredients possible.

## Tactile

This site should _feel_ pleasing to navigate. Interactions should be as satisfying as interacting with real-world objects.
