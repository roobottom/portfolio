## A pleasurable reading experience

Communication *via* the written word is one of life's great pleasures. It's essential that the reading experience on this site is delightful. Good typography is crucial and should be considered first in all designs.

## Hand-drawn

Simple hand-drawn illustrations should be used to communicate ideas more effectively. Drawings don't have to be perfect, but they should be working hard to tell a story beyond the words they support.

## Design for development

Making design decisions for ease of development means compromise. It means finding the sweet spot between the fine-grain control that a design tool like Sketch afford versus the limitations of HTML and CSS.

## Reuse

I'm a great believer in reusing components to do more than one job. This site should be designed with the smallest amount of ingredients possible.

## Tactile

This site should _feel_ pleasing to navigate. Interactions should be as satisfying as interacting with real-world objects.
