Type styles in Kanga are based on the wonderful open-source font families [_Alegreya_](https://www.huertatipografica.com/en/fonts/alegreya-ht-pro) and [_Alegreya Sans_](https://www.huertatipografica.com/en/fonts/alegreya-sans-ht) from Huerta Tipografica. 

Primarily designed for reading long-form text, these families offer flexibility with built-in OpenType features and complimentary small-caps families.

## Readability

The type scale in Kanga is based on four break points[^1] designed to give the best reading experience across multiple devices both hand-held and self-supported. 

* `base` ~ mobile phone
* `min` ~ tablet device
* `mid` ~ smaller desktop device
* `max` ~ larger desktop device or TV

## Scale

Scale between sizes is a rounded approximation of the 3/4 or major third, with a minimum text size of 15pt.

size | base | min | mid | max
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
x-small | 15.00 | 15.00 | 16.00 | 17.00
small | 15.00 | 17.25 | 19.00 | 19.00
p | 17.00 | 19.00 | 23.00 | 23.00
h4, h5, h6, introduction | 22.66 | 22.66 | 25.33 | 30.66
h3 | 30.21 | 30.21 | 33.76 | 40.87
h2 | 40.27 | 40.27 | 45.00 | 54.48
h1 | 53.68 | 53.68 | 79.97 | 96.80

## Baseline grid

Line heights for long-form copy — `x-small`, `small`, `p` and `introduction` — are based on a baseline grid of 8pt and multiples or half multiples thereof.

type size (nearest whole pt) | line height | base 8 multiple
--- | --- | --
15 | 20 | 2.5
16, 17, 19 | 24 | 3
23, 25 | 32 | 4
30 | 40 | 5

The line height for headers — `h1` _to_ `h6` — is always 1.

[^1]:This _should_ give the best reading experience based on the distance of the readers eye from the screen. Of course, this is not an exact science due to the myriad of device screen sizes and resolutions and the reader's personal preference.
