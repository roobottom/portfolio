This set of strong colours is a core part of Kanga. Use them sparingly to call out actions — navigation, buttons, etc — or as illustrative backgrounds.

You should:

* Mix them with white to create softer tones
* Create linear gradients within a family eg, `primay-dark` to `primary-light`

You shouldn't:

* Mix them with any other colours (aside from white)
* Create radial gradients, or gradients across family
