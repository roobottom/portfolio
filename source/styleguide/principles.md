## A pleasurable reading experience

Communication *via* the written word is one of life's great pleasures. It's essential that the reading experience on this site is delightful. Good typography is crucial and careful attention should be paid to the smallest detail.

## Be bold but concise

In copy, use plain English and always put the most relevant details first. Use confident visual elements, bold typography and bright colours.

## Design for development

## Consider everyone

WCAG colour guidelines. Screen readers.

## Irreverent

Design and copywriting should not be taken too seriously; Fun but never offensive or cheesy.
