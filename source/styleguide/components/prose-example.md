The prose component is the wrapper for all medium and long form writing on this site. 

A paragraph of text usually contains both **bold** and *italic* elements, and sometimes **_bold-italic_** elements. Paragraphs also sometimes contain [links](http://roobottom.com) to other interesting content.

All text in Prose is written in Markdown, so is limited to the formatting options supported by [Remarkable](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/remarkable)

## Code

Sometimes its important to mention a `variable` or other `code element`, inline. Other times, its better to show a whole block of code, like this:

```
.class-name {
  color: blue;
}
```

## Tables

Tabular data should be presented in a table element

Brian's hotel and spa | 1,872 m^3^ | €2,872,972 | 6571.29

## Punctuation and stylistic elements

Sometimes you might wish to abbreviate something, like CSS.

Other times you may need to use superscript for numbers, m^2^ or subscript for numbers, m~2~. 

You may wish to redact ~~something you’ve previously said.~~

You can also ==mark out some text== that may be of particular importance.

*[CSS]: Cascading Style Sheets
*[ANWIAN]: A number which is a number
