Since last [I wrote about our UI design library](/articles/2017-creating-a-pattern-library-in-sketch), we've made significant improvements. I thought it was time to revisit our old friend and show you what changes we've made in the last year.

Sure, it's not always been smooth sailing. And, yes, I've annoyed my team along the way demanding yet another "slight tweak" to the structure. But the UI pattern library we have today is a thing of wonder; used daily and, dare I say, loved by the team. 

The library itself — a single Sketch file — is massive. At last count we've over **350 symbols** covering the entire UI of Firefly in our four [core themes](http://themes.fireflylearning.com/). With overrides, this gives us an army of symbols with an incalculable state permutations. All the credit has to go to phenomenally talented [Aegir](http://aegir.org/) and [Rachel](http://www.rachelandersonartist.com/). They did _all_ the work.
