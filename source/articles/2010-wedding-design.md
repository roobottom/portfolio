I'm extremely lucky that I have an understanding wife who let me spend an inordinate amount of time creating print items and matching website for our wedding in August 2010.

How could I possibly resist doing all the print and web design for our wedding? At times I think Katie despaired of how much time I was putting in, but if a job’s worth doing, it’s worth doing with obsessive attention to detail.

I must admit to having been inspired by [Cable's brilliant wedding design](http://www.cabel.name/2008/10/on-wedding-design.html), so I indulged in a bit of pixel art; creating mini versions of us. Sunflowers, being Katie's favourite, also featured heavily in our wedding designs (even making an appearance as edible stickers on the cakes).

## Come to my party?

Taking advantage of an existing order, my printer pal kindly let me tack the save the dates onto the end of a run. This meant we knocked it out of the park early with lovely, litho printed, matt laminated, post-cards. Boom.

We had to _pay_ for the invites; I know, how unfair! Thankfully we found a very good (and reasonably priced) digital print shop.

## Badges

I think my favourite thing we made for the wedding was the badges. It turns out that getting custom badges made (or buttons, for our American fiends) is quite expensive. Therefore, I was able to convince Katie that we should buy our own badge making machine. Even I had to admit (after we were 100 in to the 350 I wanted to make) that, perhaps, this wasn't the great idea it first appeared to be. Nevertheless — and despite working Katie's fingers to the bone — we churned out 280 badges.

## Thanks for the memories

What a day, we loved our wedding! After our honeymoon, I combined our fabulous wedding photos with our familiar style into thank you cards for all of our guests.

## The website

Who would we be without a wedding website? Luckily I didn't have to answer such a complicated existential question as I designed *and* built one. Check out the archived version of [Jon and Katie's wedding website](https://roobottom.github.io/jonandkatie/).
