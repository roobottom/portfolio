How do you reward growth when your design team isn't large enough to offer promotion? Recently, we've been experimenting with other ways to recognise the achievements of the UI Designers on our team. 

As you progress though your design career, you may expect to eventually move through the ranks and become a manager. But what happens when the your team isn't big enough to have this type of structure, or you're simply not interested in managing people?

We've been encountering both these problems and have therefore been striving to recognise seniority in other ways. 

## Design leads and owners

In addition to the core role of UI Designer, we've introduced a group of new add-on roles to recognise seniority. These roles are assigned to the designer who has the most experience in an area. 

One person can assume multiple roles at once and these roles could pass from person to person as we grow.

Currently, we have 6 new _power-up_ roles:

* **Themes Lead** (TL) has ownership over vision and responsibility for [Firefly's four core themes](https://themes.fireflylearning.com).
* **Product Copy Lead** (PCL) has ownership over the product copy guidelines.
* **Web Design System Owner** (WSO) owns and defines best practice for our Web Design System.
* **Mobile Design Systems Owner** (MSO) owns and defines best practice for our two Mobile Design Systems.
* **Motion Design Lead** (ML) has ownership over the Motion Design guidelines.
* **Product Design Evangelist** (E) leads our efforts to socialise design thinking internally and externally.

## How this fits with reporting lines

As we grow, and people move around the structure the _power-up_ roles become another stream to recognise seniority. As our teams grow, and we find the need to add-in a new layer of people management, the _power ups_ are a way to recognise seniority in an area that's _in addition_ to reporting lines. 

{{ figure({src: 'reporting-lines.png',caption:'In the future, when we may need to add a Design Lead to manage our UI Designers; the power up roles may get redistributed. Design Leads can still carry extra power-up roles in addition to their core role duties.',class:'full'}) }}

## Where next?

As a team, we're experimenting with these new _power-up_ roles. It's our intention to iterate and improve them over time. As we discover more about what works and what doesn't, they could become just one of a whole arsenal of ways we choose to recognise achievement and seniority in design at Firefly.
