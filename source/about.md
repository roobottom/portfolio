---
Hello, my name is Jon, and I've been designing and building things for the web [since 2001](https://web.archive.org/web/20010101*/roobottom.com). Yes, I've been at this quite a while now but don't worry: I still sport a reassuringly wankerish beard and finely quaffed hair-do.

I live on England's beautiful south coast with my wife and daughter. 

## What I do

I'm the Head of Design for Firefly Learning. I lead a team of UX, visual and communication designers. It's my job to ensure they can succeed in their roles. I'm also a member of Firefly's first team: The senior leadership crew with its hand of the tiller, navigating the company through choppy waters as we attempt to grow to 450 million users. 

## What I value

Having values is good. They help me decide what work is vital and what can I can ignore. My values are like the pruning sheers of my professional life.

(How can these needs be met? I.e., movement: being given the time to go for a run at lunchtime)


### Storytelling

I believe in the power of stories and pictures to communicate complicated ideas. 

### Code

I believe in the importance of the logical, systems thinking that comes with learning how to program a computer

### Movement

I believe that great work happens when both body and mind are fit and healthy

### Never being satisfied

I believe in continually striving to better myself
