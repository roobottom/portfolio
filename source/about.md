---
Hello, my name is Jon, and I've been designing and building things for the web [since 2001](https://web.archive.org/web/20010101*/roobottom.com). Yes, I've been at this quite a while now but don't worry: I still sport a reassuringly wankerish beard and finely quaffed hair-do.

I live on England's beautiful south coast with my wife and daughter. 

## What I do

I'm the Head of Design for Firefly Learning. I lead a team of UX, visual and communication designers. It's my job to ensure they can succeed in their roles. I'm also a member of Firefly's first team: The senior leadership crew with its hand of the tiller, navigating the company through choppy waters as we attempt to grow to 450 million users. 

## What I value

I've thought long and hard about what I value at work. Acknowledging why I enjoy some roles and not others enable me to identify where I'll thrive and where I'll give my best. My values are the pruning sheers of my professional life.

### Storytelling

I believe in the persuasive power of carefully considered words and hardworking pictures for productive communication. I value time to collaboratively hone ideas through writing and drawing.

### Code

I believe in the importance of logical, systematic thinking and how I can apply this beyond code into all areas of work. I value regular time to grow my skills as a programmer.

### Building things

I find delight in the flow-state achieved when building things. I value roles that enable me to create as well as lead.

### Automation

I believe in creating systems to minimise grunt-work. I value the freedom to build these systems where they don't exist. 

Case in point is the (extremely fast) [flat-file publishing system](#) I built to run this site.

### Learning

I believe that breakthrough ideas often come from outside my area of expertise. I value indulging my lifelong love of learning.

### Movement

I believe that great work happens when both body and mind are fit and healthy. I value time away from my desk to exercise.
