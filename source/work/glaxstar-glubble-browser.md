Glubble was an add-on to Firefox which was designed to protect kids online. As Visual Designer, I created a marketing website and refreshed the UI of the product.

When Glubble's boss approached me to join his small team with the goal of creating a safe online browsing experience for younger kids I was immediately on board. They already had an alpha product but needed some help with the interface design and marketing website.

Glubble rewrote Firefox's entire interface making it impossible for kids to browse to any website that weren't in an approved list okayed by their parents. Mum and dads could choose from a library of Glubbles (themed lists of child-friendly urls) or create their own, ensuring that their progeny were protected from the webs dark and seedy corners.

## Refreshing Glubble's UI

The product was sound, but the interface was an eclectic mix of styles and unsubstantiated assumptions about how kids used computers. My first goal was updating Glubble's browser chrome. After observing some small members of my family browsing the web (on standard Firefox) it was clear that they needed no special help in getting around. What they *were* looking for was an engaging interface to make them feel that this was something especially for them. 

I created a updated browser chrome that treated them with respect (and full browser controls, including url bar), but was engaging enough to make them feel special.

## Spreading the message

Kids were the target user, but parents were the customer.
