Daunsey's is a fantastically warm and welcoming school in the heart of Wiltshire. They asked us to create a website that would help them communicate effectively with current and prospective parents.

[David](https://www.inscriptdesign.com/) (our UX designer) and I visited the school one gloriously hot afternoon in July. This co-education school is beloved by students and the good schools guide alike, and we were certainly given a warm welcome.

It became clear that to show the vibrant life in the school we'd need to design a site that was photography led. Luckily, we had the fantastic [Marcus Perkins](https://marcusperkins.co.uk/) on the case. His photos formed the core of my approach from the start. 

## Content wrangling

One big challenge on this project was just the sheer amount of information the school wanted to share online. Using various methods like card sorts and stakeholder interviews David and I were able to consolidate their main navigation into eight core areas.

We also suggested that on each area's landing page the school provide cross-links to other relevant pages in other sections. These "useful links" we're easily created from Firefly's editing interface.
