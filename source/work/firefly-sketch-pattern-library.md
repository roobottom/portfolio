The problem: 

* Never before have there been tools that enabled building of interface kits for design
* Even though Sketch gave us that ability it took several re-thinks as they released new features
* We have 4 complex themes with little 
* Version control
* Handing designs over to developers
* keeping design and dev pattern libraries in sync

What I did:

* Ran a workshop with the development and design teams to map out all our current interface patterns
* Created `patterns` and `parts` 
* Introduced Abstract as a key tool in our workflow
* Established the core colours to be applied in the same way 
* Moved all the separate libraries into one core library


Reusable kits of interface components have long been part of web development.
