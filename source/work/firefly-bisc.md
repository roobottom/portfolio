BISC asked Firefly to create a new website that would extol the virtues of this unique school to prospective students and their parents. 

[David](https://www.inscriptdesign.com/) (our UX designer) flew out to Cairo to spend time in the school where he ran several workshops with the SLT. When he returned, he was ready to go with a site-map and wireframes. He'd also taken countless photos which he shared with the rest of the team — slideshow style — to give us a flavour of the school and its culture.

What emerged was a picture of a vibrant, truly international school where every culture was respected — _ney_ — celebrated! We decided that we wanted to reflect this with a clean, open, inclusive design.

## Brand

As is often the case with schools, the only brand assets BISC could provide were a small, densely packed logo and some idea of the colours they used across their printed assets. 

Even though not part of the original brief, [Aegir](http://aegir.org/) worked with the school to create a new version of their emblem depicting the Egyptian god Throth, as well as a set of standardised brand guidelines.

## Visual language

Armed with David's colourful description of the school and Aegir's brilliant reworking of their brand I started creating a visual language for the website by predicting a number of element collages. We found these useful when discussing design direction with the school meaning we could iterate through ideas extremely quickly.

## Final designs

Both the Firefly team and client were extremely pleased with final design. We moved away somewhat from the clean lines of some of the earlier designs — adding some more bold colour blocks — but never lost that sense of inclusiveness that struck us when we first heard David passionately describe this wonderful school.
