Claire in a an up-cycling genius who asked me to create and brand and e-commerce site that would reflect her quirky style and bring her handmade gifts to the masses. 

Claire was keen to play an active role in the creation of her brand, and she had a pretty good idea of who she was and what she wanted the brand to say. 

Early version of the logo were a little too on-the-nose for Claire's tastes; too constrained and didn't reflect the simple-yet-effective nature of her products.

We spent time exploring what her products meant to her, and how her simple, bold style should be reflected in the brand. We also coined the tag-line _**handmade with love**_ that reflected the warm feeling that Claire described when crafting each of her products by hand.
