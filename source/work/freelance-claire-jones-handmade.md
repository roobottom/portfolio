Claire is an up-cycling genius who asked me to create and brand and e-commerce site that would reflect her quirky style and bring her handmade gifts to the masses. 

Claire was keen to play an active role in the creation of her brand, and she had a pretty good idea of who she was and what she wanted the brand to say. 

Early version of the logo were a little too on-the-nose for Claire's tastes; too constrained and didn't reflect the simple-yet-effective nature of her products.

We spent time exploring what her products meant to her, and how her simple, bold style should be reflected in the brand. We also coined the tag-line _**handmade with love**_ that reflected the care that Claire took when crafting each of her products by hand.

> Jon designed a fabulous brand, which I was able to use on all my merchandise as well as creating a stunning website. I had lots of comments on how attractive the website was. He also organised stickers, a self-inking stamp and business cards. Thank you Jon!

## Claire's Website

Claire had three goals for her website:

1. To have a place where she could demonstrate her products and services to partners
2. To sell her products and effortlessly update her stock 
3. To write engaging blog posts that would auto-syndicate to the Claire Jones page on Facebook

To this end, I turned to [Shopify](https://shopify.com). It offers simple tempting giving me absolute control over the look and feel without having to worry about the complicated bits-n-bobs around taking payments and managing products. 

Back in 2009, Shopify's blog functionality was pretty basic. I believe it's a different story now, but giving Claire all the features she wanted meant writing a bunch of custom scripts, that would do things like syndicate her content to Facebook.

The result was a place online that Claire could feel proud of. It gave her a home for her goods and services that would work hard for her, even when she slept.
