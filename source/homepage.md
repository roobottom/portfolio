# Clear, concise, _design_ leadership
## Design thinking; developer know-how 

Businesses the world over are reawakening to the power of in-house design teams. They're building products that are genuinely impactful, helping their customers succeed in ways they never thought possible. _Design_ is the critical ingredient. It's the special sauce that's allowing them to supercharge everything they do. 

I help organisations succeed through design by enabling teams to work smarter. With a background in design *and* development I offer the best of both worlds in my work and leadership style.

Currently, I'm the Head of Design for [Firefly Learning](https://fireflylearning.com) where I lead a team of incredibly talented UX, visual and communication designers. If you'd like to know more about how I've helped Firefly Learning succeed, read the case studies in the [work section](/work).
