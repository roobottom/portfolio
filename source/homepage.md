# Clear, concise, _design_ leadership
## Design thinking. Developer know-how. 

Businesses the world over are reawakening to the power of design. They're building products that are genuinely impactful and helping their customers succeed in ways they never thought possible. _Design_ is the critical ingredient. It's the special sauce that's allowing them to supercharge everything they do. 

I help organisations succeed through design by enabling teams to work smarter. With a background in design *and* development means I bring the best of both worlds into my work and in the way I manage designers.

Currently, I'm the Head of Design for [Firefly Learning](https://fireflylearning.com) where I lead a team of incredibly talented UX, visual and communication designers.
