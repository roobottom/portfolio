But I’m happy to say that Birmingham is undergoing a bit of a renaissance period at the moment.</p>\n<p>Over the last 5 or so years the city council (and no doubt a medley of other investors) have pumped a shed load of money into re-vamping the city centre.

It’s a really good idea, they open up the whole thing, show you round, feed you (yes, a BIG factor in deciding to go) and give you this talk on Islam. I’m impressed with anything that helps build bridges between communities, so a big thanks to those guys for making us feel so welcome.</p>\n<p>Another biking session brought me <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/roobottom/17616354/\">this very nice wound</a> and a couple of bruised ribs (hence the “ouch”).</p>\n<p>Which I guess brings me up to this week, that has so far conceited of work, a joint cell with the guys from <a href=\"http://www.eurostreams.co.uk\">Eurostreams</a> (an absolutely awesome night), the Tuesday night pub quiz, and a bit of a Bulti (init mate) with Steve, Paul, Ben and the rest of the guys from WCC.

The meal was awesome, and spirits were high, so we decided that camping would actually be a <em>really</em> good idea. I knew of a camp-site, nothing special, but this was camping right? We’d got tents and sleeping bags, what more did we need? We set off, Jayne leading the way, the last of the warm spring sun disappearing behind the rolling hills.</p>\n<p>About half way to the site, a few spots of gentle rain began to appear on the windscreen.

It conjures images of far-flung island chains, sunkissed beaches and ragged shorelines. Twenty-eight miles off the southwestern tip of England is Cornwall’s own archipelago: The Isles of Scilly.</p>\n<p>The islands are a place of contrast. Beautiful yet wild. Bright white beaches nestle alongside sea ravaged cliffs. Windswept hills sit beside sheltered coves and inlets.</p>\n<p>My wife Katie and I have visited many times: With friends; As girlfriend and boyfriend; As husband and wife; And more recently, with our small family.</p>\n<p>This is my love letter to the Islands: A collection of memories from all those trips to Scilly. Out of order and somewhat idealised. The way good memories should be.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>The crossing</h2>\n<p><em>In 2012, Katie and I were due to fly via helicopter, alas it was grounded due to technical difficulty. We had to stay overnight in Penzance and catch the ferry the following day…</em></p>\n<p>Every morning, throughout the summer a passenger ferry departs from the quay in Penzance. Aboard you’ll find serval hundred seats, two cafés and thousands of small white bags in dispensers attached to the bulkheads.</p>\n<p>This is the <em><abbr title=\"Royal Mail Vessel\">RMV</abbr> Scillonian III</em>, and she’s been transporting excited — and occasionally green — tourists from the mainland to the Isles of Scilly since 1977.</p>\n<p>(figure set:scillonian,class:pull-both)</p>\n<p>There are more comfortable ways to get to the Scillies: A small seven-seater plane dubbed <em>Skybus</em> that flies from Lands End, Newquay or Exeter. And, in times past, there was a helicopter that flew from Penzance that was always our favourite way to get to the islands. Alas, this ceased operation at the end of 2012. We were booked on a mid-morning flight, but due to there being a large hole in the side of the helicopter, we were forced to overnight in a nearby hotel to catch the ferry the following day.</p>\n<p>On this particular voyage, we secured our regular spot on the middle deck, near the back door. This is the ideal spot for Katie to sit as motionless as possible and endure any rough crossing.</p>\n<p>Knowing the best thing to do is leave her alone, this position also avails me of an escape route outside to the upper deck. From here, it’s not unusual to spot gigantic shoals of fish or even dolphins in the wake of the engines. In rough water, this is also the optimal location to enjoy the power of the seas. And to keep a weathered eye on the horizon, just in case.</p>\n<p>At capacity, the Scillonian carries 485 souls some of whom line the upper deck like birds on a telephone wire. It’s a busy place to be, people perched atop benches, leaning on the rigging, or hanging over the rails.</p>\n<p>Whatever may come, we’re all now locked together for the two-hours and forty-five-minute trip. Knowing looks are passed over the heads of the unsuspecting day trippers by those of us who’ve travelled this way before. “Poor sods” our brief eye contact seems to say, as we don our pressure point travel bands and pop an array of chemical remedies for <em>mal de mare</em>.</p>\n<p>Luckily, all this preparation is for nought. Once we rounded Gwennap Head off Lands End, and are in full steam towards the islands, most of the more unpleasant effects of the sea are behind us. On a sunny day, there’s no better way to arrive on Scilly than by boat.</p>\n<p>What’s astonishing is the speed at which the passengers disappear once we’ve docked in St Mary’s harbour. Some hang around on the quay waiting for smaller tender boats to the off-islands. Most make the happy walk up the dock, past the Mermaid pub and along Hugh Street, draining off down the various alleyways and lanes to their holiday accommodations.</p>\n<p>At any one time throughout the summer there are thousands of visitors on the islands. And yet, it doesn’t ever feel busy. Scilly is full of secret places, quiet beaches and deserted coves.</p>\n<p>Our journey took us via the <a href=\"https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g488312-d1168609-Reviews-Kavorna_Cafe_Bistro-St_Mary_s_Isles_of_Scilly_England.html\">Kavorna Café</a> (to pick up our first Cornish pasty of the holiday), over Garrison Lane and onto Littleporth to where our friend’s mum has a place that looks out over Porthcressa beach.</p>\n<p>(figure set:view,class:pull-both)</p>\n<p>Naturally, the door is unlocked. Unloading our bags in the doorway, we made our way through the house and out into the garden. Finally, we sank into various bits of unmatched garden furniture and savoured our pasties in silence, taking in the gorgeous view, ready for our holiday to start.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>A lovely day for boating</h2>\n<p><em>In 2017, my wife Katie, daughter “Roo” and I visited Scilly along with our friends Cath and Dave…</em></p>\n<p>“Mummy! I want to get up now!”</p>\n<p>I turned over and looked at my watch. 8:05. Wow, she slept well.</p>\n<p>“Daddy!”</p>\n<p>OK, kid, give me a minute here. But Katie’s already out of bed and padding down the creaky corridor.</p>\n<p>“Shh, you’ll wake Cath and Dave”, I hear Katie tell <em>Roo</em>. Rolling over I caught a glimpse of the sun streaming in at the window. Time to get up.</p>\n<p>“Mummy, we on holy-day”,  <em>Roo</em> confidently tells Katie as they, by degrees, make their way down the corridor. Katie was taking significantly more care than <em>Roo</em>, who skipped down the hall like a demented rabbit.</p>\n<p>I joined my family in the Kitchen. It really was a gorgeous day. A quick check of the BBC’s weather app informed me that it’s a balmy twenty-five degrees with light winds. A lovely day for boating.</p>\n<p>After breakfast we executed our plan: Heading for St Martins. Five of us; intrepid seafarers standing on the quay, tickets in hand watching the <em>Sea King</em> draw alongside the waiting passengers.</p>\n<p>(figure set:seaking,class:pull-both)</p>\n<p>Landing at Higher Town, our first port of call was <a href=\"http://www.theislandbakery-stmartins.com/\">The Island Bakery</a> for the day’s supplies. Fully stocked with Cornish pasties and cola cake, we trundled up the single track road and over the brow of the hill before taking the path cut through a field overgrown with Scilly’s ubiquitous Bracken. The vast swathe of white sand of Great Bay was almost deserted. Besides a few families lounging here and there we’re the only people, so finding a sheltered spot was simple.</p>\n<p>(figure set:digging,class:pull-left)</p>\n<p>Seaside days used to be a relaxed affair but with <em>Roo</em> in tow, it’s now more like mobilising a beach assault. Once the shelter was up, beach mats laid out and sun cream applied, we unpacked the various excavating tools. Thankfully she’s still a bit too small to want to bury daddy, so digging giant holes was the order of the day. <em>Roo</em> took up her position as site foreman then Dave, and I set about our task of digging several large holes and interconnecting trenches. Eventually, the tide will come up and fill this carefully engineered system, much to <em>Roo’s</em> delight, after which Dave and I will have to frantically shore-up walls and rebuild various dams.</p>\n<p>All too soon the site whistle sounds for lunch.</p>\n<p>“Lads! Lunchtime!”</p>\n<p>Sated, crumb covered, and chocolate stained we emerged from lunch. If only <em>Roo</em> can have a nap in the beach shelter, maybe we can have a relaxing hour catching up on some reading. She doesn’t take much coaxing, exhausted from bossing us around she’s happy to sleep.</p>\n<p>One or two of us drifted off too. It’s hard not to in the warmth of the day and with the rhythmic whoosh of the sea lapping at the beach. On waking, I felt the need to burn off all that pasty. It’s was time to break out the wetsuit and snorkel and explore the crystal clear waters.</p>\n<p>Wetsuit, booties, flippers, mask and flippers. All the gear and no idea. Penguin-like, I gingerly waddled my way down to the shoreline and into the freezing waters of the Atlantic. Once waist-deep, I took a big breath and rolled forward into the water. Waiting for the cold water effect to pass, I wrangled the mask into position over my face and entered the underwater world.</p>\n<p>Below the water barrier, I’m in another world entirely. From the beach, I must look like Manatee in distress, but down in my aquatic environment, I felt like Jacques Cousteau about to discover some previously unimagined species.</p>\n<p>Further out the water was clear all the way to the bottom some five meters below, where Kelp forests sheltered shoals of fish. A sudden shot of panic as my lizard brain picked up movement in my peripheral vision: A large striped fish darted out of the Kelp. I followed at a distance. He came to rest in a clearing, and I was able to float above him and just watch for what seemed like an eternity.</p>\n<p>(figure set:snorkel,class:pull-both)</p>\n<p>“I saw a <em>massive</em> fish out there”, I announced to Katie, extending my arms to demonstrate its size, adding a few centimetres in the tradition of men everywhere when talking about the size of things.</p>\n<p>“That’s nice dear”, she replied. “But we need to pack up and go, or we’ll miss the last boat back.”</p>\n<p>Everyone was contemplative on the return to St Mary’s. Even <em>Roo</em> — who was up on her knees so she could see over the side — was uncharacteristically quiet. It was hard not to get lost in that view; the ocean glinting like a blanket of tiny diamonds, the twin islands of St. Agnes and Gugh slung low on the horizon.</p>\n<p><em>Roo</em> was asleep as soon as her head hit the pillow. Perfect, especially as Dave and Cath had kindly offered to babysit.</p>\n<p>A great tradition on our visits to Scilly — perhaps <em>the</em> tradition — is partaking in a scone or two at <a href=\"http://www.julietsgardenrestaurant.co.uk/\">Juliet’s Garden</a>. Perched on top of a hill, the garden offers spectacular views over Tresco. On a warm day, there’s nothing quite like sitting in Juliet’s Garden cramming copious amounts of scone and tea into ones face.</p>\n<p>(figure set:juliets,class:span-both)</p>\n<p>Juliet isn’t just famed for her cream teas, she also runs a fantastic restaurant. On arrival this evening, Katie and I were served drinks in the garden while watching the gorgeous sunset. Then, taking our seats inside, we were treated to an incredible three-course meal.</p>\n<p>As the evening was warm, and our bellies were full we decided to forego a taxi and walk. We sat a while on the flat rock above Town Beach and watched the boat lights bobbing around in the harbour. I don’t think either of us wanted the evening to end. Eventually, though, the lure of bed called us, and we reluctantly slunk back to the house. I often think of that romantic evening on the flat rock as one of my stand out memories of our trip that year. For me, a balmy evening watching small boats on the water <em>is</em> quintessentially Scilly.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>The Scilly Cart, Co.</h2>\n<p><em>In 2014, on our last holiday, before Roo was born, we visited Scilly with our friends Cath, Dave and Emily.</em></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.scillycart.co/\">Scilly Cart Co </a> used to have a Facebook page on which it posted pictures, usually taken by disgruntled locals, of the imperfect parking decisions taken by tourists when hiring a cart for the day. When you arrive at the Cart Co’s depot, you’re greeted with a display board of these photos followed by a pep-talk by the owner on the evils of annoying the locals with where you choose to park.</p>\n<p>(figure set:cart,class:pull-left)</p>\n<p>With these words of warning rising in our ears Dave and I pulled out onto the main road, each of us determined to follow the rules to the letter. How we ended up attempting to break the land-speed record is anyone’s guess. One moment we were driving along sensibly, the next we were bouncing up and down in our seats trying to squeeze every ounce of speed we could from our formula-z cart. Needless to say, we weren’t very successful, and no traffic laws were violated.</p>\n<p>After the girls were aboard, we set out along the Telegraph Road that circles the innards of the island. There was no plan beyond maybe finding a beach and most definitely finding somewhere for lunch. I’ve gotta admit that — despite appearances — driving a golf-buggy is crazy fun. So we kept driving, twice around the island in fact, before we eventually decided we needed some lunch.</p>\n<p>This was the birth of another great tradition: Lunch at <a href=\"http://www.scillycountryhouse.com/about-us/kaffeehaus/\">Kaffeehaus Salbei</a>, a German-inspired café and guesthouse. When it’s hot, and not too busy, you can get a table outside or else swelter inside the conservatory. The German Platter is a must, with homemade bread and Bavarian meats and cheeses. Then, of course, one must have either the Apfelstrudel or — my personal favourite — a slice of Sacher Torte. I swear the cart was noticeably slower after lunch. It was either the weight of the food, or the battery had taken a beating from our multiple laps of the island.</p>\n<p>Locals on the islands often supplement their income by making things, which are offered for sale by the side of the road. An honesty box is provided for you to remunerate the artist for their handiwork. There is such a place on Porth Loo Lane. With time on our hands, we parked the cart and went for a look.</p>\n<p>(figure set:fox,class:pull-right)</p>\n<p>This particular treasure-trove was in the craftsperson’s garden shed. Inside, we found all manner of items. Some cobbled together from flotsam and jetsam. Some reclaimed from household bits and bobs. One thing, in particular, caught Dave’s eye: A fox, made from an old piece of brown carpet. One mad button eye was sewn onto its face, another for its nose. It was beautiful. It was perfect. He had to have it. I think it is a source of great regret that he didn’t buy it there and then. We should have known really, but when we returned later it was already gone. I like to think of it in an ornamental frame, in pride of place above someone’s fireplace. Lucky buggers.</p>\n<p>Later, the cart safely returned with minimal damage, we headed to the Atlantic for dinner and the pub quiz. We were all too drunk (or too stupid) to answer any of the questions well, and “team bum trumpets” inevitably place dead last.</p>\n<p>On any other evening, a night-out on Scilly would end with the closing of the pub. But not tonight, tonight we were off to Barry’s.</p>\n<p>Once a week, Barry opens the doors to his basement for the world famous Barry’s Disco. Imagine the scene: 50 sweaty people dancing the night away in a tiny basement to the hot disco “hits” of the late 90s. God knows what time we finally got out of there. Needless to say, we all had a little lay-in the next morning.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Gigs</h2>\n<p><em>In 2009, without planning to, Katie and I visited St.Mary’s in the same week as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Pilot_Gig_Championships\">World Gig Pilot Gig Championships</a>…</em></p>\n<p>All week, St.Mary’s had been its usual, tranquil place: Little sailing boats had bobbed in the harbour; Gentle winds had blown across the sun-kissed beaches. And the island’s pubs and eateries had no queues at the bar or required bookings for dinner.</p>\n<p>That all changed on Friday morning when the Scillonian docked and brought ashore the first of the revellers who’d come to Scilly to enjoy the weekend’s racing. The Isles of Scilly Steamship Company runs the Scillonian twice-a-day on Gig weekends, dumping several thousand people on the islands in quick succession.</p>\n<p>The whole character of the island was transformed. Pubs, who’d obtained exclusive licences for the occasion, remained open 24-hours a day for the duration. There was a not-so-small minority of people who were here for the weekend, but hadn’t anywhere to stay, electing instead to spend their entire time in the boozer.</p>\n<p>This didn’t dent the enjoyment, far from it. Experiencing this new aspect of Scilly was exciting. Everyone was very jolly, and even a weekend fuelled by alcohol and little sleep didn’t seem to dampen their enthusiasm for cheering on their team.</p>\n<p>If you’re not familiar, a Cornish Pilot Gig is a six-person boat about 10 meters long and 1.5 meters wide. In addition to the six rowers, a Cox steers and shouts encouragement and is responsible for ensuring the crew makes land before last orders.</p>\n<p>Gigs are a common sight on the Scillies. Their names, like “Slippen”, “Bonnet” and “Nornour” pay homage to the memory of their namesakes who, in the 17th and 18th centuries, were used as transfer vessels to take Pilots out to larger ships. A Pilot was a local sailor who could navigate safely through the treacherous, rock-laden waters of the archipelago.</p>\n<p>We got chatting with a man in a pub. A misty-eyed old sea dog. He told us that it was often the case that more than one Pilot was available at any one time, and the first man to arrive would get the job. So the Gig crews took to racing, the fastest sailors would get paid, and that’s how the Gig races on the Isles started. It’s a romantic story, and I’d like to believe it’s true.</p>\n<p>The races start out at sea. The officials string a line buoys to form a start line out by Nut Rock. The crews then wait in their boats as close to the start line as they can. But woe betides any vessel that crosses the line before “go” is called. They get instantly disqualified.</p>\n<p>There are old rivalries and alliances between teams who come from all over the world. These all go out of the window once the call comes to start. Every crew for themselves. A crew of six, pulling for all their worth. From the start line, they race across the clear stretch of water to St.Mary’s harbour.</p>\n<p>From our vantage point up on the Garrison, it looks pandemonium; oars churning the sea into a raging torrent. All around the Gigs are the island’s small ferry boats filled to bursting with spectators who’ve paid for the privilege of a close-up view. Add to this the hundreds of smaller private crafts, and you wonder how they don’t smash into each other.</p>\n<p>All around us, people are screaming at the top of their lungs, as if the object of their affection could actually hear them way out at sea. I wouldn’t be surprised if they could, such is the roar of the crowd.</p>\n<p>The shouting reached fever pitch as the first of the boats rounded the quay, finish line in sight. Given how long they’ve been racing the gap between them was astonishingly close. I’m not sure how they tell, but the first Gig to cross the finish line immediately started to celebrate. They must have been knackered, but somehow they found the strength to row the final few meters to Town Beach. Here, there’s a whole army of people to help them drag the Gig up onto the beach.</p>\n<p>(figure set:gigs,class:pull-both)</p>\n<p>Wanting to drink-in more of the atmosphere and a couple of the local ales, Katie and I headed to the Mermaid. This place is incredibly claustrophobic at the best of times, with memorabilia covering every inch of every available surface. Saturday evenings are particularly busy, but this was something else. We could see punters spilling out onto the pavement as we approached. The only way to get in was to forcibly push through the sweaty throng. I imagine as we introduced ourselves into the crush, two other people were ejected from another door somewhere. This place was full.</p>\n<p>Inside the beer was flowing. People were dancing on tables. Tall tales were being told of the day’s victories. Somehow we managed to get a seat, Katie on the end of a bench, and me perched awkwardly on a window ledge. What a night! We emerged several hours later, a little drunk and horse from trying to make ourselves heard.</p>\n<p>This is one of my favourite memories of the Islands. I felt totally immersed in the culture. Caught-up in something. It was a unique experience that I don’t think we could ever recapture. In a way, I wouldn’t want to. It was perfect, trying to get it back would somehow sully it.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Taking flight</h2>\n<p><em>In 2008, I took my first trip to the islands, and my first flight on a helicopter…</em></p>\n<p>There’s always a sadness that accompanies leaving the Isles of Scilly. It started for me this first year and has never diminished on subsequent trips. At least you used to be able to offset this with the excitement of a trip on the helicopter.</p>\n<p>After waving goodbye to our bags, which would be taken to the airport for us by Island Carriers, we headed into town. Now was the chance to buy as much <abbr title=\"Isles of Scilly\">IOS</abbr> branded tat as we could lay our grubby hands on. Of course, there was the Isles of Scilly tea towel; The Isles of Scilly fridge magnet; The Isles of Scilly puffin jigsaw; And the Isles of Scilly pencil and pencil sharpener deluxe set. Our friends and family were, understandably, delighted!</p>\n<p>Maxing-out your baggage allowance on a helicopter is surprisingly straightforward. We discovered this at check-in when both of our cases — now laden with souvenirs — were well over the 15 kg limit. Luckily the airport staff were as laid-back as every other islander we’d met, and waved us through.</p>\n<p>St.Mary’s Airport is by far the smallest terminal I’ve ever flown from. It’s miniature waiting area probably never any busier than it was now. A few people milled around, while others enjoyed hot drinks from styrofoam cups.</p>\n<p>When the time came, we were called into a small side room with the other passengers for our flight. Here, we were shown a short safety film from the late 80s. Then we heard it. A helicopter coming into land. The great throb-throb-throb of its propeller blades displacing the air.</p>\n<p>One of British International’s two <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikorsky_S-61\">Sikorsky S-61</a> helicopters landed with the slightest bounce. The side door flung open, and the passengers disembarked, ducking instinctively under the rotor blades.</p>\n<p>(figure set:helicopter,class:pull-both)</p>\n<p>Then it was our turn. Our air steward lead the way out onto the runway. We ducked under the rotors too, clinging desperately to lose items of clothing. Of course, we felt like rock stars.</p>\n<p>Once belts were fastened, the door was shut behind us with a reassuringly heavy click. Not that you can hear much above the roar of the engine, which now wound up ready for take-off. We felt an increase in the side-to-side wobble, and suddenly we were moving. The helicopter’s nose tipped forward and we swept up and along the runway. It’s exhilarating! The raw power that’s required to push this massive metal tube into the air must be immense. You feel every last joule of it.</p>\n<p>The view is spectacular. Passengers lucky enough to get window seats were furiously taking as many photos as they could. It’s too loud for conversation, so we just gesticulated to each other, pointing at things we recognised.</p>\n<p>Flying at 150 <abbr title=\"Miles Per Hour\">mph</abbr>, it only takes 20 minutes from St.Marys to Penzance. All too soon the islands disappeared over the horizon, and Lands End appeared in the port side windows. Moments later we were touching down at Penzance heliport.</p>\n<p>And that was that. Suddenly we were back to reality. Cars and people everywhere. Waiting for our bags, Katie asked me what I thought. She’d been extolling the virtues of Scilly since we’d met. “I’m in love”, I said. Or something like that. That’s the problem with memories, isn’t it? It’s sometimes hard to tell them apart from dreams.</p>\n"},{"title":"Tuscany with a toddler","date":"2017-04-18T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["travel","italy","toddlers"],"images":[{"image":"roo-alps.jpg","caption":"Roo, captivated by the view of the Alps from 38,000 ft","set":"alps"},{"image":"alps.jpg","caption":"The view of the Alps","set":"alps"},{"image":"house.jpg","caption":"Our villa for the week in San Lorenzo a Vaccoli, Lucca","set":"house"},{"image":"bike-in-lucca.jpg","caption":"Katie and Roo cycling on the walls of Lucca.","set":"bike"},{"image":"lunch-in-lucca.jpg","caption":"Enjoying some Pizza at Ristorante San Colombano, Lucca","set":"lunch"},{"image":"lucca-skyline.jpg","caption":"The view from the top of the Torre Delle Ore, Lucca","set":"tower"},{"image":"merry-go-round.jpg","caption":"Katie and Roo enjoying the Merry-go-round, goodness knows who she’s waving at","set":"merrygoround"},{"image":"leaning-tower.jpg","caption":"Of course we had to take this shot of the Leaning Tower","set":"leaningtower"},{"image":"gardens-pisa.jpg","caption":"Grandma and Roo enjoying the shade in the Botanical Gardens in Pisa","set":"gardens"},{"image":"last-day.jpg","caption":"Katie, my dad and mum in the grounds of our villa on the last day","set":"lastday"}],"filename":"63","content":"<p>As a surprise for my mum’s 70th, my dad invited us on a pre Easter break to a house he’d rented in San Lorenzo a Vaccoli, a sleepy village a few kilometres outside of Lucca, in Italy’s Tuscany region.</p>\n<p>The ratio of 4 adults to one toddler certainly made things a little easier with <em>Roo</em>. She had a brilliant time! Here’s some of the things we liked:</p>\n<h2>Flying</h2>\n<p>In contrast to the last time we flew with <em>Roo</em>, this time we’d deliberately not booked flights which demanded us be at the airport at some ungodly hour. This meant that she wasn’t tired and therefore in a good mood.</p>\n<p>We were also a lot more prepared this time, we didn’t forget to bring her headphones or iPad pre-loaded with Peppa Pig.</p>\n<p>The weather on the way out made for an especially memorable flight over the Alps. I really love this picture of <em>Roo</em>, captivated by the view:</p>\n<p>(figure set:alps)</p>\n<h2>Our house</h2>\n<p>Our little home from home wasn’t so little! Being early in the season meant we picked up a bargain, and we’re able to stay in a massive country villa with amazing views. <em>Roo</em> especially loved the large fenced gardens, meaning she could tear around outside in relative safety. Being independent is increasingly important to her at the moment, so this was great.</p>\n<p>(figure set:house)</p>\n<h2>Pisa</h2>\n<p>Although she quite enjoyed having her picture taken holding up the leaning tower, Pisa isn’t the most relaxing place to visit with a small child. We spent a few hours here, but any more would’ve pushed <em>Roo</em> over the edge and into the canyon of tantrum.</p>\n<p>(figure set:leaningtower)</p>\n<p>One thing we <em>did</em> really like here was the Botanical Gardens. These we’re uncrowded and gave <em>Roo</em> ample room to run around amongst the beautiful flowers. If you find yourself in Pisa with a small child, seek them out. For only €4 an adult, they’re the perfect antidote to the crowds in the Square of Miracles.</p>\n<p>(figure set:gardens)</p>\n<h2>Lucca</h2>\n<p>Lucca is a fabulous place. We spent a couple of different days here, the first time just for a few hours to grab lunch and explore until the inevitable tiredness-time-bomb went off and a screaming child forced us home for tea.</p>\n<p>The second time, while my mum and dad went off to Florence, Katie, <em>Roo</em> and I spent a whole day here. We hired a side-by-side bicycle, which she <em>loved</em>, shouting “ciao” at passers-by.</p>\n<p>(figure set:bike)</p>\n<p>We had more pizza outside at a <a href=\"http://www.ristorantesancolombanolucca.it/en/\">lovely restaurant</a> where the staff we’re amazing with <em>Roo</em>, bringing her food out extremely quickly. This is mission critical, as I’m sure anyone with a hungry toddler in a public place will know.</p>\n<p>(figure set:lunch)</p>\n<p>After lunch, with <em>Roo</em> asleep in the push-chair, we explored the tiny winding streets. It was idilic in the afternoon sun. Katie went off to shop, and I took the opportunity to climb the recently restored <em>Torre Delle Ore</em>. The effort of climbing the 470 steps was rewarded at the top with an amazing view of the whole city and surrounding hills.</p>\n<p>(figure set:tower)</p>\n<p><em>Roo</em> woke up on the way back to the car, just as we were passing the merry go round. “I go on that?” she said. How could we refuse?</p>\n<p>(figure set:merrygoround)</p>\n<p>I’d highly recommend Lucca as an easy city to visit with a toddler. It had none of the crowds of Pisa, and felt an altogether more chilled out place.</p>\n<h2>In summary</h2>\n<p>We really hit the jackpot with both the location and weather for our week in northern Tuscany. There’s lot to enjoy for little people in this region if you’re prepared to miss out on some of the more famous places, and go where the crowds aren’t. We certainly had a brilliant time!</p>\n<p>(figure set:lastday)</p>\n"},{"title":"First holiday with a toddler","date":"2016-10-31T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["travel","Portugal","toddlers"],"images":[{"image":"maratona-1.jpg","caption":"Lovely food at the Maratona Café","set":"maratona"},{"image":"maratona-2.jpg","caption":"Cheeky chops","set":"maratona"},{"image":"albobaca.jpg","caption":"Exploring the monastery at Albobaça","set":"monastery"},{"image":"oceanarium-1.jpg","caption":"Loves a fish, this one","set":"oceanarium"},{"image":"oceanarium-2.jpg","caption":"Lisbon Oceanarium","set":"oceanarium"},{"image":"buddha-1.jpg","caption":"The Buddha Eden in Bombarral","set":"buddha"},{"image":"buddha-2.jpg","caption":"Posing for the camera at the Buddha Eden in Bombarral","set":"buddha"},{"image":"park.jpg","caption":"In the park in Caldas da Rainha","set":"park"},{"image":"beach.jpg","caption":"On the beach","set":"park"}],"filename":"57","content":"<p>We recently spent a week in Portugal where we rented a villa just outside Caldas da Rainha, a mid-sized town, an hour’s drive north of Lisbon.</p>\n<p>For our first family holiday, we’d decided to play it safe and booked a somewhere child-friendly on <a href=\"https://www.holidaytots.co.uk/\">Holiday Tots</a>. It was great! It had a gated pool, and all the toys the child could ever want. It was also close to beaches, restaurants and interesting places to visit.</p>\n<p>The weather was a bit of a mixed bag, we had a few nice days, but if you like it hot (Like I do) then mid-October isn’t really the time to visit Portugal. It certainly wasn’t warm enough to heat the solar-powered pool heater. I went in a few times, but it was too cold for Katie and <em>Roo</em>.</p>\n<h2>Striking a balance</h2>\n<p>Every now and again I have a moment where it dawns on me that we have a child now, and our lives will never be the same again. Our first family holiday was one of those moments. Gone were the late night meals-out and morning lay-ins of holidays gone by. We could no longer plan days out that consisted purely of thing that Katie and I wanted to do. We had a little head to consider.</p>\n<h2>Things we liked</h2>\n<p>I think we managed to strike a balance, and found activities that we all enjoyed. <em>Roo</em> (for the most part) was happy to go with the flow, and enjoyed exploring new places.</p>\n<p>Here’s some of the things we liked in and around Caldas da Rainha.</p>\n<h3>Food</h3>\n<p>The Portuguese all seemed to love children, so made eating out at lunch extremely easy. There were excellent restaurants almost  everywhere we went, but a personal favourite was the vegetarian restaurant <a href=\"http://maratona.tv/\">Maratona</a> in the centre of Caldas. They were brilliant with <em>Roo</em>, rushing through an order of chips to prevent the inevitable mealtime meltdown.</p>\n<p>(figure set:maratona)</p>\n<h3>Exploring</h3>\n<p>We were delighted to find that <em>Roo</em> didn’t mind mooching around villages and towns. She was fascinated by the shops full of (mainly tile-based) gifts. As long as she was fed and could enjoy the occasional ice cream she was happy.</p>\n<p>The monastery at Albobaça was a particular favourite, with it’s large stone rooms. She loved hearing her footsteps and voice echoing down the corridors, <em>“echo, Mummy!”</em></p>\n<p>(figure set:monastery,class:span-both)</p>\n<p>We also really liked \u000fÓbidos, a fortified city that dates back to the 13th century. She loved the shops, castle and ice cream. We loved exploring the castle walls, the wonderful weather and the local cherry liqueur that you drink from a chocolate cup.</p>\n<h3>Lisbon Oceanarium</h3>\n<p>She <em>loved</em> the Oceanarium in Lisbon. We did have to queue a little for tickets (top tip: book online before you go) but the efficient staff meant our wait was fairly short.</p>\n<p>I would love to know what she was thinking as she stared up at the double-floor height tank full, packed to the <em>gills</em> with all kind of fish. Its difficult to know what goes through that little head, but she chatted about <em>“fsh”</em> all the way back to the Villa.</p>\n<p>(figure set:oceanarium)</p>\n<h3>Buddha Eden</h3>\n<p>The Buddha Eden in Bombarral is an amazing place. Set in 30 acres of beautiful gardens are hundreds of sculptures from all over Asia. <em>Roo</em> loved the wide open spaces and all the huge sculptures. There’s also some well times cafés where we were able to refuel while <em>Roo</em> had a sleep in her push-chair.</p>\n<p>(figure set:buddha)</p>\n<h3>Beaches, parks and gardens</h3>\n<p>Besides all the things we paid money for, there were plenty of free things that we enjoyed too. There is a beautiful park in Caldas that was a big hit with <em>Roo</em>, full of amazing green spaces, a lovely play-park and a couple of nice cafés.</p>\n<p>There’s also some really great beaches in this area, which were deserted when we visited, it being so late in the year. The sea was freezing, but that didn’t stop <em>Roo</em> enjoying a paddle.</p>\n<p>(figure set:park)</p>\n<h2>Things we didn’t like as much</h2>\n<p>The flight home was a bit rubbish. We’d stayed in a hotel at the airport the night before, but hadn’t really thought through the night sharing a room with <em>Roo</em>. So, between a disturbed night in a strange room and the 4:30am start to get our early flight its fair to say that <em>Roo</em> wasn’t in the best of moods.</p>\n<p>Halfway home, in order to placate our struggling child, Katie had taken her on a walk down the isle to visit the cabin crew. While there she decided to vomit over the side of the plane and several unsuspecting passengers. Tiredness had gotten the better of her.</p>\n<h2>In summary</h2>\n<p>We had a brilliant time in Portugal, we’d thoroughly recommend it as a holiday destination with a small child. It was different, for sure, but I think we made it work, and made some more happy memories with the <em>Roo</em>.</p>\n"},{"date":"2013-09-22T00:00:00.000Z","title":"European Adventure Week Three","images":[{"image":"boat-on-lake-magorie.jpg","caption":"Beautiful Lake Magorie, Switzerland","set":"lake-magorie"},{"image":"lacarno-square.jpg","caption":"Lacarno Square","set":"lacarno-square"},{"image":"verzasca.jpg","caption":"The dizzying heights at Verzasca Dam","set":"verzasca"},{"image":"trendcamping.jpg","caption":"Archie at Trendcamping, Germany","set":"trendcamping"},{"image":"wolfach-2.jpg","caption":"Wolfach","set":"wolfach"},{"image":"wolfach.jpg","caption":"Wolfach","set":"wolfach"},{"image":"iledefaigneul.jpg","caption":"Camping Ile de Faigneul","set":"faigneul"},{"image":"calais.jpg","caption":"Katie at Calais Eurotunnel on our last day","set":"calis"}],"cover":"/assets/blog/covers/boat-on-lake-magorie.jpg","introduction":"Our final week, a last hurrah, and a dash across Switzerland, Germany, Belgium and France.","tags":["travel","capervanning","switzerland","germany","belgium","france"],"related_gallery":["/gallery/europe-2013-switzerland-germany-and-belgium"],"filename":"43","content":"<p>Our final week, a last hurrah, and a dash across Switzerland, Germany, Belgium and France.</p>\n<p>It was the briefest of interludes into Switzerland, still, in this country at least we managed to abide by the law and buy a Vignette at the border.</p>\n<p>Our destination was a campsite not far from the northern lake town of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locarno\">Lacarno</a>. After the damp squib that was our final day in Italy, the well-appointed campsite <a href=\"http://www.lidomappo.ch\">Lido Mappo</a> was most welcome. And, what luck! A break in the weather which allowed Katie and I to get our tent up and once again double our living space. That evening we paid a brief (but expensive) visit to the campsite bar, then cooked-up a pasta-storm back at chez-Roobottom.</p>\n<p>We awoke on Tuesday to beautiful sunshine. Using a combination of extremely poor Italian and much better English (on the part of the campsite staff) we’d established the the thing to do 'round these parts was to take the air with a brisk walk into Lacarno.</p>\n<p>Being near the border Lacarno has brilliant mixture of Italian Joie de vivre and Swiss preciseness, that for us <em>slightly</em> obsessive compulsive types, is infinitely appearing. We ate pizza in the square before hiking up the many almost vertical side-streets to explore.</p>\n<p>(figure set:lacarno-square)</p>\n<p>I think the most abiding memory of this place is the view over the lake. I don’t really think there’s anything to separate this place from Lake Garda, it’s just different, but equally beautiful. I managed to get some pictures that <em>almost</em> capture some small part of it’s beauty. I imagine it’s hard to communicate the feeling you associate with a place through pictures or words alone. It’s probably why those that do are few and far between. I’m certainly not counting myself there, if you were wondering.</p>\n<p>(figure set:lake-magorie)</p>\n<p>In the afternoon we took the camper up the mountain to the Verzasca Dam where apparently, if you’re so inclined, you can do a <a href=\"http://www.trekking.ch/en/bungy/007-bungy-jumping-verzasca-like-james-bond\">220m bungee jump</a> just like James Bond in Goldeneye. As we weren’t feeling <em>that</em> adventurous we made do with scaring ourselves by gawping over the fence at the dizzying drop. Why, after seeing that, you’d want to tie a piece of elastic around your legs and jump off I really couldn’t guess.</p>\n<p>(figure set:verzasca)</p>\n<p>On Wednesday we moved on to Germany, excited for our next adventure, but with the glimpse of the heavy heart that always accompanies a return to reality after a spectacular holiday. And spectacular this holiday has certainly been. It seems surreal at this point we’ve already driven nearly 2,000 miles. Pat on the head, van, for not letting us down — Thank goodness we didn’t buy a VW.</p>\n<p>It’s a sign of how far north we now were that we saw the first British numberplate for almost two weeks. Then another, and another. By the time we arrived at <a href=\"http://www.trendcamping.de\">Trend Camping</a> we were surrounded by the buggers.</p>\n<p>(figure set:trendcamping)</p>\n<p>The campsite had a rather nice bar which severed traditional German fare and local ales. So, despite the mud, it got the thumbs up from us. Especially when we discovered the huge power-showers, with massaging side-jets and everything. Luxury.</p>\n<p>On Thursday we used the free bus and train pass that the campsite provided to visit the nearby <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfach\">Wolfach</a>, a jolly little place that was once the hub of log-rafting and home to the pom-pom hat.</p>\n<p>The center of the town is lovely, with cobbled streets and shops full of delicious looking things. It’s surrounded by glorious grassy hills and meadows, the kind you might imagine yourself running through into the arms of a Bavarian maiden. If you were so inclined.</p>\n<p>(gallery set:wolfach)</p>\n<p>And then it was Friday. Only two days left of our holiday. How did that happen? Oh well, we thought, nothing for it but to spend some time in Belgium.</p>\n<p>What an amazing find for our last night. <a href=\"http://www.iledefaigneul.com\">Camping Ile de Faigneul</a> is a site on it’s own island in the middle of a river. We’d have loved to spend more time in this tranquil place, but alas this was just an overnight stop on our way to Calais, the tunnel and home.</p>\n<p>(figure set:faigneul)</p>\n<p>We spent that last night as we did some many others, eating pasta, playing cards and watching Mad Men.</p>\n<p>So it was with heavy hearts that we made our way thorough France to the Eurotunnel. We just had time to shop in the insanely large supermarket complex in Calais before boarding our train back to normality.</p>\n<p>(figure set:calis)</p>\n<p>That was it then. The end of a fantastic adventure that was entirely too short. It got dark at some point while were under the sea. Emerging onto cold, damp British soil we felt ready for a bed that wasn’t <em>slightly</em> too short. Home then.

Headphones in, I’m listening to Fink’s “Sort of Revolution” extremely loud and enjoying an ice-cold beer. I lean my head back, and close my eyes against the sun as it dapples through the leaves above me. In the distance are the mountains that circle Lake Garda. Sparse clouds are suspended, seemingly motionless over the azure blue waters. Fuelled by the warmth of the sun, the melodic beat of the music and the haze from the alcohol I feel an almost zen-like sense of well-being. “This is perfect” I thought.</p>\n<p>In contrast to week one, when we’d travelled through five countries, we decided to slow the pace a little. After an epic drive our first stop was the Northern lake town of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nago–Torbole\">Torbole</a>, the windsurfers paradise, and <a href=\"http://www.campingalporto.it/camp/\">Camping Al Porto</a>. It felt Newquay-esq where board-shorts seemed to be the must-have fashion item of the season. The campsite was rather busier than those we’d been used to, but we managed to fit our van and awning on a shaded pitch thirty-seconds walk from the lake.</p>\n<p>(figure set:torbole)</p>\n<p>On the occasion of our first night in Italy, we did what we have the last two trips here: Find the most touristy looking restaurant and order the biggest pizza they have and a glass of the local beer. In this case it was <a href=\"http://www.forst.it/eng\">Forst</a>, brewed “just up the road” we were told.</p>\n<p>The next day we had ideas of taking windsurfing lesson but the wind didn’t seem to want to blow. It was probably too hot, so like us it decided to spend the day sunbathing and exploring the town. We also finally got the BBQ to work despite the crappy “just light the bag” charcoal, thanks to some German firelighters that almost took my face off.</p>\n<p>It was at this point we cheated a little by spending a few nights in a hotel south of the lake in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desenzano_del_Garda\">Desenzano del Garda</a>. “You know” said Katie “I’m loving being able to get out of the shower and being able to keep my feet dry.” I knew what she meant. I’m not proud to admit it but we really did wallow in the luxurious of it all.</p>\n<p>(gallery set:hotel)</p>\n<p>Peeling ourselves away from the hotel pool we ventured down the road to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirmione\">Sirmione</a>. Navigating the spit of land that forms a sort of natural pier into the centre of the southern bank of the lake — we parked and ventured over the bridge into down-town Sirmione. Here we indulged our inner tourist once again by eating gelato and watching the sunset.</p>\n<p>(figure set:sirmione)</p>\n<p>Having made a large dent in our holiday funds we checked out of the hotel and moved north around the lake to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazise\">Lazise</a>. Here we encountered the full glory of the Italian campsite. When you’re a good few kilometres from the centre on the main road you start to notice the signs. At first a just few, then more with increasing ferocity until they line the bank of the lake one after the other. You’re not, as we discovered, just expected to pick one and check-in. We spent an interesting couple of hours driving from site to site inspecting toilet blocks, pools, children’s entertainment and on-site bars before we finally gave in and just picked one.</p>\n<p>(figure set:lazisesite)</p>\n<p>Here we stayed and for four glorious days enjoyed the private beach and exploring the beautiful town. We swam, snorkelled and sunbathed. Ate gelato, pizza and even brought a fridge-magnet. No messing about, this was a proper holiday.</p>\n<p>Alas, it was time to move on. Switzerland and our final week beaconed. We have a week left and just over two-thousand kilometres back to the Euro-tunnel at Calais.</p>\n<p>To be continued…</p>\n"},{"date":"2013-09-07T00:00:00.000Z","title":"European Adventure Week One","section":"articles","introduction":"Being of noble birth Katie and I are taking in the sights of Europe on a three week grand tour","tags":["capervanning","travel","france","germany","austria"],"cover":"/assets/blog/covers/01-20150102233740.jpg","images":[{"image":"alps.jpg","caption":"Driving over the Alps","set":"alps"},{"image":"france.jpg","caption":"Our first night at Camping des Bruyeres","set":"france"},{"image":"adam-night.jpg","caption":"The view from our van at Campingplatz Adam","set":"adam"},{"image":"baden_lunch.jpg","caption":"Lunch in Baden-Baden","set":"baden"},{"image":"salzburg.jpg","caption":"Downtown Salzburg","set":"salzburg"},{"image":"pavilion.jpg","caption":"Katie outside the \"Sixteen Going on Seventeen\" pavilion","set":"pavilion"}],"filename":"41","content":"<p>Being of noble birth Katie and I are taking in the sights of Europe on a three week grand tour.</p>\n<p>However, having a chequebook that is of more moderate means we decided to conduct our trip in our campervan.</p>\n<p>As I write this, we are driving from Salzburg to Lake Garda through the Alps. The scenery is breathtaking and a road sign tells me it’s  27 degrees, perfect driving weather, if our air con still worked.</p>\n<p>(figure set:alps)</p>\n<p>At this point we’ve covered 1,703 km and aside from a little smoke up some of the steeper sections of motorway our van is performing well.

Actually, the drive turned out to be pretty straight-forward aside from one incident when we somehow missed the road closed signs and found ourselves driving over freshly prepared gravel, workmen shaking their heads in disbelief as we passed.</p>\n<p>(figure set:adam)</p>\n<p>We stayed in the beautiful campgrounds for three days, swimming in the lake and generally not doing much of anything. On the second day we managed to peel ourselves away and drove into Baden-Baden, where we partook of some very European things like eating outside and strolling along the promenade. Our Britishness didn’t like that very much and forced us onto the Dotto train so we’d feel more like tourists again. Phew.</p>\n<p>(figure set:baden)</p>\n<p>Sad as we were to leave, Salzburg beckoned, so we packed up the van and set off. This was another sweaty drive along Euro-route 52. Six hours later we were lost in the city. In situations like this Katie stays calm and I tend to overreact (a little). Ahem. Anyway, luckily on this occasion Katie was behind the wheel and did a sterling job of navigating the 5pm traffic until we <em>finally</em> reached <a href=\"http://www.panorama-camping.at/cms/index.php?lang=en\">Panorama Camping</a>.</p>\n<p>Wow, what a site! Brilliant views and with WC and show blocks that wouldn’t have been out of place in a five-star hotel. It’s also here that I first discovered the local brew, Stiegl.</p>\n<p>The next day (despite <em>really</em> enjoying the beer) we made an early start into Salzburg. I’d once been here on a school trip but the only thing I remember with any clarity was the McDonalds. Katie kept insisting that the hills were alive with the sound of music, but I wasn’t sure what she meant by this.</p>\n<p>Arriving by bus into Mozartsteg we made our way through the square, past the stalls selling Bavarian hats and up the hill to the fortress Hohensalzburg. After exploring for a bit we sat, pretzel and beer in hand, admiring the stunning view over the mountains.</p>\n<p>(figure set:salzburg)</p>\n<p>Next, I discovered a little more about those musical hills with a Sound of Music themed bus tour of the city. I secretly really enjoyed this ride around the sights of the city made (even more) famous by the film. We ended our day with a plate of Snitzel at the Stiegl brewery restaurant with (yup, you guessed it) a refreshing cold beer.</p>\n<p>(figure set:pavilion)</p>\n<p>Next is Lake Garda, it’s already hotter than Austria, so onto Italy!</p>\n<p>To be continued…</p>\n"},{"date":"2007-10-16T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Lake Garda, Italy","images":[{"image":"1586607502_2ae186c936_o.jpg","set":"lake","caption":"Me and her by the lake"},{"image":"1586170404_39ede07bdb_o.jpg","set":"lake2","caption":"Sirmione"},{"image":"1585611537_e540e1204f_o.jpg","set":"gondola","caption":"Gondola"}],"tags":["travel","italy"],"filename":"27","content":"<p>The weather was warm, the food was amazing and the wine was cheep. After 7 nights in Italy drifting around Lake Garda, being awed (and a little romantic) in Verona and getting (very) lost in Venice the reality of being back to work has hit like a tonne of bricks.</p>\n<p>(figure set:lake)</p>\n<p>But I prefer to think of the amazing time we had. As we landed at the tiny Besica airport we realised that the turbulence we had just endured was in fact heavy rain that drenched us as we ran from the plane to the cover of the arrivals lounge. From there we found ourselves sitting in the hire car, rain pounding on the windscreen, trying to get used to the uneasy feeling of sitting in the passenger side with a steering wheel in front of me. By the time we reached <a href=\"http://www.mistralhotels.it/admiral.htm\">our hotel</a> we’d driven on three motorways and had a tiny disagreement with a barrier.</p>\n<p>Thankfully the wing-mirror was unharmed and the rain had stopped to reveal blue sky. Things got even better when we got into our room - it was clean, big and had a balcony from which you could see the lake (sort of) through the trees. We spent the week exploring Lake Garda’s small towns and excellent restaurants, and venturing out to Verona and eventually Venice after planning to go on Wednesday and finally getting there on Friday - Due to a couple of days missing the train. Whoops!</p>\n<p>(figure set:lake2)</p>\n<p>My favourite place by far was Sirmione which was at the end of an tiny outcrop of land that juts into the south end of the lake. We spent an evening at the naturally heated <a href=\"http://www.termedisirmione.it/tds/en/homepage.html\">spa</a> followed by dinner at <a href=\"http://www.ristorantearcimboldo.com/\">L’Archimboldo</a> run by a really friendly guy who’s English was better than ours. If you’re going to Lake Garda Sirmione is a must.</p>\n<p>(figure set:gondola)</p>\n<p>Venice was amazing. Stepping out of the station, you’re immediately greeted with throngs of people walking up and down the banks of the Grand Canal. Wow! We took a water taxi up to St. Marks Square and stopped for lunch and some shelter from the hot-hot sun before we ventured into St Mark’s Basilica and mooched around the Square, avoiding the millions of pigeons that randomly landed on anyone they fancied, whether they had food or not.</p>\n<p>We then set off around the labyrinth-like city on foot, exploring the seemingly unending passageways and tiny bridges. Needless to say we got horribly lost, and only just made our train back to the hotel. But I loved Venice, a day was just not enough. In usual style, I took nearly 700 photos - and you can <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/roobottom/sets/72157602449502521/\">see some of them over at flickr</a>.</p>\n<p>Oh well, back to reality I suppose.</p>\n"},{"date":"2005-12-15T00:00:00.000Z","title":"The Rain in Spain","tags":["travel"],"images":[{"image":"metro-in-spain.jpg","caption":"The Metro ~ Plaza de Espana","set":"a"}],"filename":"9","content":"<p>(figure set:a)</p>\n<p>Isn’t it funny how you meet new people?

So we set off: Four blokes, one van and Jayne (Chris’ sat-nav lady friend) - Gripped, sorted, we were ready to off-road. The riding was good, nothing too challenging, just easy riding to ease us back in after the long winter.</p>\n<p>So as we left for the pub about 5.30pm the sun was shining and all was right with the world. The meal was awesome, and spirits were high, so we decided that camping would actually be a <em>really</em> good idea. I knew of a camp-site, nothing special, but this was camping right? We’d got tents and sleeping bags, what more did we need? We set off, Jayne leading the way, the last of the warm spring sun disappearing behind the rolling hills.</p>\n<p>About half way to the site, a few spots of gentle rain began to appear on the windscreen.

It conjures images of far-flung island chains, sunkissed beaches and ragged shorelines. Twenty-eight miles off the southwestern tip of England is Cornwall’s own archipelago: The Isles of Scilly.</p>\n<p>The islands are a place of contrast. Beautiful yet wild. Bright white beaches nestle alongside sea ravaged cliffs. Windswept hills sit beside sheltered coves and inlets.</p>\n<p>My wife Katie and I have visited many times: With friends; As girlfriend and boyfriend; As husband and wife; And more recently, with our small family.</p>\n<p>This is my love letter to the Islands: A collection of memories from all those trips to Scilly. Out of order and somewhat idealised. The way good memories should be.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>The crossing</h2>\n<p><em>In 2012, Katie and I were due to fly via helicopter, alas it was grounded due to technical difficulty. We had to stay overnight in Penzance and catch the ferry the following day…</em></p>\n<p>Every morning, throughout the summer a passenger ferry departs from the quay in Penzance. Aboard you’ll find serval hundred seats, two cafés and thousands of small white bags in dispensers attached to the bulkheads.</p>\n<p>This is the <em><abbr title=\"Royal Mail Vessel\">RMV</abbr> Scillonian III</em>, and she’s been transporting excited — and occasionally green — tourists from the mainland to the Isles of Scilly since 1977.</p>\n<p>(figure set:scillonian,class:pull-both)</p>\n<p>There are more comfortable ways to get to the Scillies: A small seven-seater plane dubbed <em>Skybus</em> that flies from Lands End, Newquay or Exeter. And, in times past, there was a helicopter that flew from Penzance that was always our favourite way to get to the islands. Alas, this ceased operation at the end of 2012. We were booked on a mid-morning flight, but due to there being a large hole in the side of the helicopter, we were forced to overnight in a nearby hotel to catch the ferry the following day.</p>\n<p>On this particular voyage, we secured our regular spot on the middle deck, near the back door. This is the ideal spot for Katie to sit as motionless as possible and endure any rough crossing.</p>\n<p>Knowing the best thing to do is leave her alone, this position also avails me of an escape route outside to the upper deck. From here, it’s not unusual to spot gigantic shoals of fish or even dolphins in the wake of the engines. In rough water, this is also the optimal location to enjoy the power of the seas. And to keep a weathered eye on the horizon, just in case.</p>\n<p>At capacity, the Scillonian carries 485 souls some of whom line the upper deck like birds on a telephone wire. It’s a busy place to be, people perched atop benches, leaning on the rigging, or hanging over the rails.</p>\n<p>Whatever may come, we’re all now locked together for the two-hours and forty-five-minute trip. Knowing looks are passed over the heads of the unsuspecting day trippers by those of us who’ve travelled this way before. “Poor sods” our brief eye contact seems to say, as we don our pressure point travel bands and pop an array of chemical remedies for <em>mal de mare</em>.</p>\n<p>Luckily, all this preparation is for nought. Once we rounded Gwennap Head off Lands End, and are in full steam towards the islands, most of the more unpleasant effects of the sea are behind us. On a sunny day, there’s no better way to arrive on Scilly than by boat.</p>\n<p>What’s astonishing is the speed at which the passengers disappear once we’ve docked in St Mary’s harbour. Some hang around on the quay waiting for smaller tender boats to the off-islands. Most make the happy walk up the dock, past the Mermaid pub and along Hugh Street, draining off down the various alleyways and lanes to their holiday accommodations.</p>\n<p>At any one time throughout the summer there are thousands of visitors on the islands. And yet, it doesn’t ever feel busy. Scilly is full of secret places, quiet beaches and deserted coves.</p>\n<p>Our journey took us via the <a href=\"https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g488312-d1168609-Reviews-Kavorna_Cafe_Bistro-St_Mary_s_Isles_of_Scilly_England.html\">Kavorna Café</a> (to pick up our first Cornish pasty of the holiday), over Garrison Lane and onto Littleporth to where our friend’s mum has a place that looks out over Porthcressa beach.</p>\n<p>(figure set:view,class:pull-both)</p>\n<p>Naturally, the door is unlocked. Unloading our bags in the doorway, we made our way through the house and out into the garden. Finally, we sank into various bits of unmatched garden furniture and savoured our pasties in silence, taking in the gorgeous view, ready for our holiday to start.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>A lovely day for boating</h2>\n<p><em>In 2017, my wife Katie, daughter “Roo” and I visited Scilly along with our friends Cath and Dave…</em></p>\n<p>“Mummy! I want to get up now!”</p>\n<p>I turned over and looked at my watch. 8:05. Wow, she slept well.</p>\n<p>“Daddy!”</p>\n<p>OK, kid, give me a minute here. But Katie’s already out of bed and padding down the creaky corridor.</p>\n<p>“Shh, you’ll wake Cath and Dave”, I hear Katie tell <em>Roo</em>. Rolling over I caught a glimpse of the sun streaming in at the window. Time to get up.</p>\n<p>“Mummy, we on holy-day”,  <em>Roo</em> confidently tells Katie as they, by degrees, make their way down the corridor. Katie was taking significantly more care than <em>Roo</em>, who skipped down the hall like a demented rabbit.</p>\n<p>I joined my family in the Kitchen. It really was a gorgeous day. A quick check of the BBC’s weather app informed me that it’s a balmy twenty-five degrees with light winds. A lovely day for boating.</p>\n<p>After breakfast we executed our plan: Heading for St Martins. Five of us; intrepid seafarers standing on the quay, tickets in hand watching the <em>Sea King</em> draw alongside the waiting passengers.</p>\n<p>(figure set:seaking,class:pull-both)</p>\n<p>Landing at Higher Town, our first port of call was <a href=\"http://www.theislandbakery-stmartins.com/\">The Island Bakery</a> for the day’s supplies. Fully stocked with Cornish pasties and cola cake, we trundled up the single track road and over the brow of the hill before taking the path cut through a field overgrown with Scilly’s ubiquitous Bracken. The vast swathe of white sand of Great Bay was almost deserted. Besides a few families lounging here and there we’re the only people, so finding a sheltered spot was simple.</p>\n<p>(figure set:digging,class:pull-left)</p>\n<p>Seaside days used to be a relaxed affair but with <em>Roo</em> in tow, it’s now more like mobilising a beach assault. Once the shelter was up, beach mats laid out and sun cream applied, we unpacked the various excavating tools. Thankfully she’s still a bit too small to want to bury daddy, so digging giant holes was the order of the day. <em>Roo</em> took up her position as site foreman then Dave, and I set about our task of digging several large holes and interconnecting trenches. Eventually, the tide will come up and fill this carefully engineered system, much to <em>Roo’s</em> delight, after which Dave and I will have to frantically shore-up walls and rebuild various dams.</p>\n<p>All too soon the site whistle sounds for lunch.</p>\n<p>“Lads! Lunchtime!”</p>\n<p>Sated, crumb covered, and chocolate stained we emerged from lunch. If only <em>Roo</em> can have a nap in the beach shelter, maybe we can have a relaxing hour catching up on some reading. She doesn’t take much coaxing, exhausted from bossing us around she’s happy to sleep.</p>\n<p>One or two of us drifted off too. It’s hard not to in the warmth of the day and with the rhythmic whoosh of the sea lapping at the beach. On waking, I felt the need to burn off all that pasty. It’s was time to break out the wetsuit and snorkel and explore the crystal clear waters.</p>\n<p>Wetsuit, booties, flippers, mask and flippers. All the gear and no idea. Penguin-like, I gingerly waddled my way down to the shoreline and into the freezing waters of the Atlantic. Once waist-deep, I took a big breath and rolled forward into the water. Waiting for the cold water effect to pass, I wrangled the mask into position over my face and entered the underwater world.</p>\n<p>Below the water barrier, I’m in another world entirely. From the beach, I must look like Manatee in distress, but down in my aquatic environment, I felt like Jacques Cousteau about to discover some previously unimagined species.</p>\n<p>Further out the water was clear all the way to the bottom some five meters below, where Kelp forests sheltered shoals of fish. A sudden shot of panic as my lizard brain picked up movement in my peripheral vision: A large striped fish darted out of the Kelp. I followed at a distance. He came to rest in a clearing, and I was able to float above him and just watch for what seemed like an eternity.</p>\n<p>(figure set:snorkel,class:pull-both)</p>\n<p>“I saw a <em>massive</em> fish out there”, I announced to Katie, extending my arms to demonstrate its size, adding a few centimetres in the tradition of men everywhere when talking about the size of things.</p>\n<p>“That’s nice dear”, she replied. “But we need to pack up and go, or we’ll miss the last boat back.”</p>\n<p>Everyone was contemplative on the return to St Mary’s. Even <em>Roo</em> — who was up on her knees so she could see over the side — was uncharacteristically quiet. It was hard not to get lost in that view; the ocean glinting like a blanket of tiny diamonds, the twin islands of St. Agnes and Gugh slung low on the horizon.</p>\n<p><em>Roo</em> was asleep as soon as her head hit the pillow. Perfect, especially as Dave and Cath had kindly offered to babysit.</p>\n<p>A great tradition on our visits to Scilly — perhaps <em>the</em> tradition — is partaking in a scone or two at <a href=\"http://www.julietsgardenrestaurant.co.uk/\">Juliet’s Garden</a>. Perched on top of a hill, the garden offers spectacular views over Tresco. On a warm day, there’s nothing quite like sitting in Juliet’s Garden cramming copious amounts of scone and tea into ones face.</p>\n<p>(figure set:juliets,class:span-both)</p>\n<p>Juliet isn’t just famed for her cream teas, she also runs a fantastic restaurant. On arrival this evening, Katie and I were served drinks in the garden while watching the gorgeous sunset. Then, taking our seats inside, we were treated to an incredible three-course meal.</p>\n<p>As the evening was warm, and our bellies were full we decided to forego a taxi and walk. We sat a while on the flat rock above Town Beach and watched the boat lights bobbing around in the harbour. I don’t think either of us wanted the evening to end. Eventually, though, the lure of bed called us, and we reluctantly slunk back to the house. I often think of that romantic evening on the flat rock as one of my stand out memories of our trip that year. For me, a balmy evening watching small boats on the water <em>is</em> quintessentially Scilly.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>The Scilly Cart, Co.</h2>\n<p><em>In 2014, on our last holiday, before Roo was born, we visited Scilly with our friends Cath, Dave and Emily.</em></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.scillycart.co/\">Scilly Cart Co </a> used to have a Facebook page on which it posted pictures, usually taken by disgruntled locals, of the imperfect parking decisions taken by tourists when hiring a cart for the day. When you arrive at the Cart Co’s depot, you’re greeted with a display board of these photos followed by a pep-talk by the owner on the evils of annoying the locals with where you choose to park.</p>\n<p>(figure set:cart,class:pull-left)</p>\n<p>With these words of warning rising in our ears Dave and I pulled out onto the main road, each of us determined to follow the rules to the letter. How we ended up attempting to break the land-speed record is anyone’s guess. One moment we were driving along sensibly, the next we were bouncing up and down in our seats trying to squeeze every ounce of speed we could from our formula-z cart. Needless to say, we weren’t very successful, and no traffic laws were violated.</p>\n<p>After the girls were aboard, we set out along the Telegraph Road that circles the innards of the island. There was no plan beyond maybe finding a beach and most definitely finding somewhere for lunch. I’ve gotta admit that — despite appearances — driving a golf-buggy is crazy fun. So we kept driving, twice around the island in fact, before we eventually decided we needed some lunch.</p>\n<p>This was the birth of another great tradition: Lunch at <a href=\"http://www.scillycountryhouse.com/about-us/kaffeehaus/\">Kaffeehaus Salbei</a>, a German-inspired café and guesthouse. When it’s hot, and not too busy, you can get a table outside or else swelter inside the conservatory. The German Platter is a must, with homemade bread and Bavarian meats and cheeses. Then, of course, one must have either the Apfelstrudel or — my personal favourite — a slice of Sacher Torte. I swear the cart was noticeably slower after lunch. It was either the weight of the food, or the battery had taken a beating from our multiple laps of the island.</p>\n<p>Locals on the islands often supplement their income by making things, which are offered for sale by the side of the road. An honesty box is provided for you to remunerate the artist for their handiwork. There is such a place on Porth Loo Lane. With time on our hands, we parked the cart and went for a look.</p>\n<p>(figure set:fox,class:pull-right)</p>\n<p>This particular treasure-trove was in the craftsperson’s garden shed. Inside, we found all manner of items. Some cobbled together from flotsam and jetsam. Some reclaimed from household bits and bobs. One thing, in particular, caught Dave’s eye: A fox, made from an old piece of brown carpet. One mad button eye was sewn onto its face, another for its nose. It was beautiful. It was perfect. He had to have it. I think it is a source of great regret that he didn’t buy it there and then. We should have known really, but when we returned later it was already gone. I like to think of it in an ornamental frame, in pride of place above someone’s fireplace. Lucky buggers.</p>\n<p>Later, the cart safely returned with minimal damage, we headed to the Atlantic for dinner and the pub quiz. We were all too drunk (or too stupid) to answer any of the questions well, and “team bum trumpets” inevitably place dead last.</p>\n<p>On any other evening, a night-out on Scilly would end with the closing of the pub. But not tonight, tonight we were off to Barry’s.</p>\n<p>Once a week, Barry opens the doors to his basement for the world famous Barry’s Disco. Imagine the scene: 50 sweaty people dancing the night away in a tiny basement to the hot disco “hits” of the late 90s. God knows what time we finally got out of there. Needless to say, we all had a little lay-in the next morning.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Gigs</h2>\n<p><em>In 2009, without planning to, Katie and I visited St.Mary’s in the same week as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Pilot_Gig_Championships\">World Gig Pilot Gig Championships</a>…</em></p>\n<p>All week, St.Mary’s had been its usual, tranquil place: Little sailing boats had bobbed in the harbour; Gentle winds had blown across the sun-kissed beaches. And the island’s pubs and eateries had no queues at the bar or required bookings for dinner.</p>\n<p>That all changed on Friday morning when the Scillonian docked and brought ashore the first of the revellers who’d come to Scilly to enjoy the weekend’s racing. The Isles of Scilly Steamship Company runs the Scillonian twice-a-day on Gig weekends, dumping several thousand people on the islands in quick succession.</p>\n<p>The whole character of the island was transformed. Pubs, who’d obtained exclusive licences for the occasion, remained open 24-hours a day for the duration. There was a not-so-small minority of people who were here for the weekend, but hadn’t anywhere to stay, electing instead to spend their entire time in the boozer.</p>\n<p>This didn’t dent the enjoyment, far from it. Experiencing this new aspect of Scilly was exciting. Everyone was very jolly, and even a weekend fuelled by alcohol and little sleep didn’t seem to dampen their enthusiasm for cheering on their team.</p>\n<p>If you’re not familiar, a Cornish Pilot Gig is a six-person boat about 10 meters long and 1.5 meters wide. In addition to the six rowers, a Cox steers and shouts encouragement and is responsible for ensuring the crew makes land before last orders.</p>\n<p>Gigs are a common sight on the Scillies. Their names, like “Slippen”, “Bonnet” and “Nornour” pay homage to the memory of their namesakes who, in the 17th and 18th centuries, were used as transfer vessels to take Pilots out to larger ships. A Pilot was a local sailor who could navigate safely through the treacherous, rock-laden waters of the archipelago.</p>\n<p>We got chatting with a man in a pub. A misty-eyed old sea dog. He told us that it was often the case that more than one Pilot was available at any one time, and the first man to arrive would get the job. So the Gig crews took to racing, the fastest sailors would get paid, and that’s how the Gig races on the Isles started. It’s a romantic story, and I’d like to believe it’s true.</p>\n<p>The races start out at sea. The officials string a line buoys to form a start line out by Nut Rock. The crews then wait in their boats as close to the start line as they can. But woe betides any vessel that crosses the line before “go” is called. They get instantly disqualified.</p>\n<p>There are old rivalries and alliances between teams who come from all over the world. These all go out of the window once the call comes to start. Every crew for themselves. A crew of six, pulling for all their worth. From the start line, they race across the clear stretch of water to St.Mary’s harbour.</p>\n<p>From our vantage point up on the Garrison, it looks pandemonium; oars churning the sea into a raging torrent. All around the Gigs are the island’s small ferry boats filled to bursting with spectators who’ve paid for the privilege of a close-up view. Add to this the hundreds of smaller private crafts, and you wonder how they don’t smash into each other.</p>\n<p>All around us, people are screaming at the top of their lungs, as if the object of their affection could actually hear them way out at sea. I wouldn’t be surprised if they could, such is the roar of the crowd.</p>\n<p>The shouting reached fever pitch as the first of the boats rounded the quay, finish line in sight. Given how long they’ve been racing the gap between them was astonishingly close. I’m not sure how they tell, but the first Gig to cross the finish line immediately started to celebrate. They must have been knackered, but somehow they found the strength to row the final few meters to Town Beach. Here, there’s a whole army of people to help them drag the Gig up onto the beach.</p>\n<p>(figure set:gigs,class:pull-both)</p>\n<p>Wanting to drink-in more of the atmosphere and a couple of the local ales, Katie and I headed to the Mermaid. This place is incredibly claustrophobic at the best of times, with memorabilia covering every inch of every available surface. Saturday evenings are particularly busy, but this was something else. We could see punters spilling out onto the pavement as we approached. The only way to get in was to forcibly push through the sweaty throng. I imagine as we introduced ourselves into the crush, two other people were ejected from another door somewhere. This place was full.</p>\n<p>Inside the beer was flowing. People were dancing on tables. Tall tales were being told of the day’s victories. Somehow we managed to get a seat, Katie on the end of a bench, and me perched awkwardly on a window ledge. What a night! We emerged several hours later, a little drunk and horse from trying to make ourselves heard.</p>\n<p>This is one of my favourite memories of the Islands. I felt totally immersed in the culture. Caught-up in something. It was a unique experience that I don’t think we could ever recapture. In a way, I wouldn’t want to. It was perfect, trying to get it back would somehow sully it.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Taking flight</h2>\n<p><em>In 2008, I took my first trip to the islands, and my first flight on a helicopter…</em></p>\n<p>There’s always a sadness that accompanies leaving the Isles of Scilly. It started for me this first year and has never diminished on subsequent trips. At least you used to be able to offset this with the excitement of a trip on the helicopter.</p>\n<p>After waving goodbye to our bags, which would be taken to the airport for us by Island Carriers, we headed into town. Now was the chance to buy as much <abbr title=\"Isles of Scilly\">IOS</abbr> branded tat as we could lay our grubby hands on. Of course, there was the Isles of Scilly tea towel; The Isles of Scilly fridge magnet; The Isles of Scilly puffin jigsaw; And the Isles of Scilly pencil and pencil sharpener deluxe set. Our friends and family were, understandably, delighted!</p>\n<p>Maxing-out your baggage allowance on a helicopter is surprisingly straightforward. We discovered this at check-in when both of our cases — now laden with souvenirs — were well over the 15 kg limit. Luckily the airport staff were as laid-back as every other islander we’d met, and waved us through.</p>\n<p>St.Mary’s Airport is by far the smallest terminal I’ve ever flown from. It’s miniature waiting area probably never any busier than it was now. A few people milled around, while others enjoyed hot drinks from styrofoam cups.</p>\n<p>When the time came, we were called into a small side room with the other passengers for our flight. Here, we were shown a short safety film from the late 80s. Then we heard it. A helicopter coming into land. The great throb-throb-throb of its propeller blades displacing the air.</p>\n<p>One of British International’s two <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikorsky_S-61\">Sikorsky S-61</a> helicopters landed with the slightest bounce. The side door flung open, and the passengers disembarked, ducking instinctively under the rotor blades.</p>\n<p>(figure set:helicopter,class:pull-both)</p>\n<p>Then it was our turn. Our air steward lead the way out onto the runway. We ducked under the rotors too, clinging desperately to lose items of clothing. Of course, we felt like rock stars.</p>\n<p>Once belts were fastened, the door was shut behind us with a reassuringly heavy click. Not that you can hear much above the roar of the engine, which now wound up ready for take-off. We felt an increase in the side-to-side wobble, and suddenly we were moving. The helicopter’s nose tipped forward and we swept up and along the runway. It’s exhilarating! The raw power that’s required to push this massive metal tube into the air must be immense. You feel every last joule of it.</p>\n<p>The view is spectacular. Passengers lucky enough to get window seats were furiously taking as many photos as they could. It’s too loud for conversation, so we just gesticulated to each other, pointing at things we recognised.</p>\n<p>Flying at 150 <abbr title=\"Miles Per Hour\">mph</abbr>, it only takes 20 minutes from St.Marys to Penzance. All too soon the islands disappeared over the horizon, and Lands End appeared in the port side windows. Moments later we were touching down at Penzance heliport.</p>\n<p>And that was that. Suddenly we were back to reality. Cars and people everywhere. Waiting for our bags, Katie asked me what I thought. She’d been extolling the virtues of Scilly since we’d met. “I’m in love”, I said. Or something like that. That’s the problem with memories, isn’t it? It’s sometimes hard to tell them apart from dreams.</p>\n"}]},{"name":"cornwall","count":2,"items":[{"title":"A love letter to a tiny island","date":"2018-01-10T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["travel","isles of scilly","cornwall","england"],"images":[{"image":"scillonian.jpg","caption":"Looking back at the mainland from the stern of the RMV Scillonian III, somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean","set":"scillonian"},{"image":"view.jpg","caption":"The view from Cath’s mum’s cottage over Littleporth","set":"view"},{"image":"sea-king.jpg","caption":"Skipper Fraser Hicks pilots the Sea King into St.Mary’s harbour","set":"seaking"},{"image":"digging.jpg","caption":"My little excavation expert","set":"digging"},{"image":"fish.jpg","caption":"A “massive” fish","set":"snorkel"},{"image":"jelly.jpg","caption":"A jelly fish, a Portuguese Man-O-War?","set":"snorkel"},{"image":"juliets.jpg","caption":"The stunning views from Juliet’s Garden","set":"juliets"},{"image":"at-juliets.jpg","caption":"Katie and me enjoying a drink in the last of the evening sunshine at Juliet’s Garden","set":"juliets"},{"image":"carting.jpg","caption":"Dave driving our formula-z cart","set":"cart"},{"image":"fox-carpet.jpg","caption":"The fox carpet of your dreams","set":"fox"},{"image":"gigs.jpg","caption":"Organised chaos on town beach as Gigs are landed after a race","set":"gigs"},{"image":"scilly-helicopter.jpg","caption":"British International Helicopters Sikorsky S-61 after landing on Tresco in 2008","set":"helicopter"}],"filename":"68","content":"<p>“Archipelago” is such a lovely word. It conjures images of far-flung island chains, sunkissed beaches and ragged shorelines. Twenty-eight miles off the southwestern tip of England is Cornwall’s own archipelago: The Isles of Scilly.</p>\n<p>The islands are a place of contrast. Beautiful yet wild. Bright white beaches nestle alongside sea ravaged cliffs. Windswept hills sit beside sheltered coves and inlets.</p>\n<p>My wife Katie and I have visited many times: With friends; As girlfriend and boyfriend; As husband and wife; And more recently, with our small family.</p>\n<p>This is my love letter to the Islands: A collection of memories from all those trips to Scilly. Out of order and somewhat idealised. The way good memories should be.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>The crossing</h2>\n<p><em>In 2012, Katie and I were due to fly via helicopter, alas it was grounded due to technical difficulty. We had to stay overnight in Penzance and catch the ferry the following day…</em></p>\n<p>Every morning, throughout the summer a passenger ferry departs from the quay in Penzance. Aboard you’ll find serval hundred seats, two cafés and thousands of small white bags in dispensers attached to the bulkheads.</p>\n<p>This is the <em><abbr title=\"Royal Mail Vessel\">RMV</abbr> Scillonian III</em>, and she’s been transporting excited — and occasionally green — tourists from the mainland to the Isles of Scilly since 1977.</p>\n<p>(figure set:scillonian,class:pull-both)</p>\n<p>There are more comfortable ways to get to the Scillies: A small seven-seater plane dubbed <em>Skybus</em> that flies from Lands End, Newquay or Exeter. And, in times past, there was a helicopter that flew from Penzance that was always our favourite way to get to the islands. Alas, this ceased operation at the end of 2012. We were booked on a mid-morning flight, but due to there being a large hole in the side of the helicopter, we were forced to overnight in a nearby hotel to catch the ferry the following day.</p>\n<p>On this particular voyage, we secured our regular spot on the middle deck, near the back door. This is the ideal spot for Katie to sit as motionless as possible and endure any rough crossing.</p>\n<p>Knowing the best thing to do is leave her alone, this position also avails me of an escape route outside to the upper deck. From here, it’s not unusual to spot gigantic shoals of fish or even dolphins in the wake of the engines. In rough water, this is also the optimal location to enjoy the power of the seas. And to keep a weathered eye on the horizon, just in case.</p>\n<p>At capacity, the Scillonian carries 485 souls some of whom line the upper deck like birds on a telephone wire. It’s a busy place to be, people perched atop benches, leaning on the rigging, or hanging over the rails.</p>\n<p>Whatever may come, we’re all now locked together for the two-hours and forty-five-minute trip. Knowing looks are passed over the heads of the unsuspecting day trippers by those of us who’ve travelled this way before. “Poor sods” our brief eye contact seems to say, as we don our pressure point travel bands and pop an array of chemical remedies for <em>mal de mare</em>.</p>\n<p>Luckily, all this preparation is for nought. Once we rounded Gwennap Head off Lands End, and are in full steam towards the islands, most of the more unpleasant effects of the sea are behind us. On a sunny day, there’s no better way to arrive on Scilly than by boat.</p>\n<p>What’s astonishing is the speed at which the passengers disappear once we’ve docked in St Mary’s harbour. Some hang around on the quay waiting for smaller tender boats to the off-islands. Most make the happy walk up the dock, past the Mermaid pub and along Hugh Street, draining off down the various alleyways and lanes to their holiday accommodations.</p>\n<p>At any one time throughout the summer there are thousands of visitors on the islands. And yet, it doesn’t ever feel busy. Scilly is full of secret places, quiet beaches and deserted coves.</p>\n<p>Our journey took us via the <a href=\"https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g488312-d1168609-Reviews-Kavorna_Cafe_Bistro-St_Mary_s_Isles_of_Scilly_England.html\">Kavorna Café</a> (to pick up our first Cornish pasty of the holiday), over Garrison Lane and onto Littleporth to where our friend’s mum has a place that looks out over Porthcressa beach.</p>\n<p>(figure set:view,class:pull-both)</p>\n<p>Naturally, the door is unlocked. Unloading our bags in the doorway, we made our way through the house and out into the garden. Finally, we sank into various bits of unmatched garden furniture and savoured our pasties in silence, taking in the gorgeous view, ready for our holiday to start.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>A lovely day for boating</h2>\n<p><em>In 2017, my wife Katie, daughter “Roo” and I visited Scilly along with our friends Cath and Dave…</em></p>\n<p>“Mummy! I want to get up now!”</p>\n<p>I turned over and looked at my watch. 8:05. Wow, she slept well.</p>\n<p>“Daddy!”</p>\n<p>OK, kid, give me a minute here. But Katie’s already out of bed and padding down the creaky corridor.</p>\n<p>“Shh, you’ll wake Cath and Dave”, I hear Katie tell <em>Roo</em>. Rolling over I caught a glimpse of the sun streaming in at the window. Time to get up.</p>\n<p>“Mummy, we on holy-day”,  <em>Roo</em> confidently tells Katie as they, by degrees, make their way down the corridor. Katie was taking significantly more care than <em>Roo</em>, who skipped down the hall like a demented rabbit.</p>\n<p>I joined my family in the Kitchen. It really was a gorgeous day. A quick check of the BBC’s weather app informed me that it’s a balmy twenty-five degrees with light winds. A lovely day for boating.</p>\n<p>After breakfast we executed our plan: Heading for St Martins. Five of us; intrepid seafarers standing on the quay, tickets in hand watching the <em>Sea King</em> draw alongside the waiting passengers.</p>\n<p>(figure set:seaking,class:pull-both)</p>\n<p>Landing at Higher Town, our first port of call was <a href=\"http://www.theislandbakery-stmartins.com/\">The Island Bakery</a> for the day’s supplies. Fully stocked with Cornish pasties and cola cake, we trundled up the single track road and over the brow of the hill before taking the path cut through a field overgrown with Scilly’s ubiquitous Bracken. The vast swathe of white sand of Great Bay was almost deserted. Besides a few families lounging here and there we’re the only people, so finding a sheltered spot was simple.</p>\n<p>(figure set:digging,class:pull-left)</p>\n<p>Seaside days used to be a relaxed affair but with <em>Roo</em> in tow, it’s now more like mobilising a beach assault. Once the shelter was up, beach mats laid out and sun cream applied, we unpacked the various excavating tools. Thankfully she’s still a bit too small to want to bury daddy, so digging giant holes was the order of the day. <em>Roo</em> took up her position as site foreman then Dave, and I set about our task of digging several large holes and interconnecting trenches. Eventually, the tide will come up and fill this carefully engineered system, much to <em>Roo’s</em> delight, after which Dave and I will have to frantically shore-up walls and rebuild various dams.</p>\n<p>All too soon the site whistle sounds for lunch.</p>\n<p>“Lads! Lunchtime!”</p>\n<p>Sated, crumb covered, and chocolate stained we emerged from lunch. If only <em>Roo</em> can have a nap in the beach shelter, maybe we can have a relaxing hour catching up on some reading. She doesn’t take much coaxing, exhausted from bossing us around she’s happy to sleep.</p>\n<p>One or two of us drifted off too. It’s hard not to in the warmth of the day and with the rhythmic whoosh of the sea lapping at the beach. On waking, I felt the need to burn off all that pasty. It’s was time to break out the wetsuit and snorkel and explore the crystal clear waters.</p>\n<p>Wetsuit, booties, flippers, mask and flippers. All the gear and no idea. Penguin-like, I gingerly waddled my way down to the shoreline and into the freezing waters of the Atlantic. Once waist-deep, I took a big breath and rolled forward into the water. Waiting for the cold water effect to pass, I wrangled the mask into position over my face and entered the underwater world.</p>\n<p>Below the water barrier, I’m in another world entirely. From the beach, I must look like Manatee in distress, but down in my aquatic environment, I felt like Jacques Cousteau about to discover some previously unimagined species.</p>\n<p>Further out the water was clear all the way to the bottom some five meters below, where Kelp forests sheltered shoals of fish. A sudden shot of panic as my lizard brain picked up movement in my peripheral vision: A large striped fish darted out of the Kelp. I followed at a distance. He came to rest in a clearing, and I was able to float above him and just watch for what seemed like an eternity.</p>\n<p>(figure set:snorkel,class:pull-both)</p>\n<p>“I saw a <em>massive</em> fish out there”, I announced to Katie, extending my arms to demonstrate its size, adding a few centimetres in the tradition of men everywhere when talking about the size of things.</p>\n<p>“That’s nice dear”, she replied. “But we need to pack up and go, or we’ll miss the last boat back.”</p>\n<p>Everyone was contemplative on the return to St Mary’s. Even <em>Roo</em> — who was up on her knees so she could see over the side — was uncharacteristically quiet. It was hard not to get lost in that view; the ocean glinting like a blanket of tiny diamonds, the twin islands of St. Agnes and Gugh slung low on the horizon.</p>\n<p><em>Roo</em> was asleep as soon as her head hit the pillow. Perfect, especially as Dave and Cath had kindly offered to babysit.</p>\n<p>A great tradition on our visits to Scilly — perhaps <em>the</em> tradition — is partaking in a scone or two at <a href=\"http://www.julietsgardenrestaurant.co.uk/\">Juliet’s Garden</a>. Perched on top of a hill, the garden offers spectacular views over Tresco. On a warm day, there’s nothing quite like sitting in Juliet’s Garden cramming copious amounts of scone and tea into ones face.</p>\n<p>(figure set:juliets,class:span-both)</p>\n<p>Juliet isn’t just famed for her cream teas, she also runs a fantastic restaurant. On arrival this evening, Katie and I were served drinks in the garden while watching the gorgeous sunset. Then, taking our seats inside, we were treated to an incredible three-course meal.</p>\n<p>As the evening was warm, and our bellies were full we decided to forego a taxi and walk. We sat a while on the flat rock above Town Beach and watched the boat lights bobbing around in the harbour. I don’t think either of us wanted the evening to end. Eventually, though, the lure of bed called us, and we reluctantly slunk back to the house. I often think of that romantic evening on the flat rock as one of my stand out memories of our trip that year. For me, a balmy evening watching small boats on the water <em>is</em> quintessentially Scilly.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>The Scilly Cart, Co.</h2>\n<p><em>In 2014, on our last holiday, before Roo was born, we visited Scilly with our friends Cath, Dave and Emily.</em></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.scillycart.co/\">Scilly Cart Co </a> used to have a Facebook page on which it posted pictures, usually taken by disgruntled locals, of the imperfect parking decisions taken by tourists when hiring a cart for the day. When you arrive at the Cart Co’s depot, you’re greeted with a display board of these photos followed by a pep-talk by the owner on the evils of annoying the locals with where you choose to park.</p>\n<p>(figure set:cart,class:pull-left)</p>\n<p>With these words of warning rising in our ears Dave and I pulled out onto the main road, each of us determined to follow the rules to the letter. How we ended up attempting to break the land-speed record is anyone’s guess. One moment we were driving along sensibly, the next we were bouncing up and down in our seats trying to squeeze every ounce of speed we could from our formula-z cart. Needless to say, we weren’t very successful, and no traffic laws were violated.</p>\n<p>After the girls were aboard, we set out along the Telegraph Road that circles the innards of the island. There was no plan beyond maybe finding a beach and most definitely finding somewhere for lunch. I’ve gotta admit that — despite appearances — driving a golf-buggy is crazy fun. So we kept driving, twice around the island in fact, before we eventually decided we needed some lunch.</p>\n<p>This was the birth of another great tradition: Lunch at <a href=\"http://www.scillycountryhouse.com/about-us/kaffeehaus/\">Kaffeehaus Salbei</a>, a German-inspired café and guesthouse. When it’s hot, and not too busy, you can get a table outside or else swelter inside the conservatory. The German Platter is a must, with homemade bread and Bavarian meats and cheeses. Then, of course, one must have either the Apfelstrudel or — my personal favourite — a slice of Sacher Torte. I swear the cart was noticeably slower after lunch. It was either the weight of the food, or the battery had taken a beating from our multiple laps of the island.</p>\n<p>Locals on the islands often supplement their income by making things, which are offered for sale by the side of the road. An honesty box is provided for you to remunerate the artist for their handiwork. There is such a place on Porth Loo Lane. With time on our hands, we parked the cart and went for a look.</p>\n<p>(figure set:fox,class:pull-right)</p>\n<p>This particular treasure-trove was in the craftsperson’s garden shed. Inside, we found all manner of items. Some cobbled together from flotsam and jetsam. Some reclaimed from household bits and bobs. One thing, in particular, caught Dave’s eye: A fox, made from an old piece of brown carpet. One mad button eye was sewn onto its face, another for its nose. It was beautiful. It was perfect. He had to have it. I think it is a source of great regret that he didn’t buy it there and then. We should have known really, but when we returned later it was already gone. I like to think of it in an ornamental frame, in pride of place above someone’s fireplace. Lucky buggers.</p>\n<p>Later, the cart safely returned with minimal damage, we headed to the Atlantic for dinner and the pub quiz. We were all too drunk (or too stupid) to answer any of the questions well, and “team bum trumpets” inevitably place dead last.</p>\n<p>On any other evening, a night-out on Scilly would end with the closing of the pub. But not tonight, tonight we were off to Barry’s.</p>\n<p>Once a week, Barry opens the doors to his basement for the world famous Barry’s Disco. Imagine the scene: 50 sweaty people dancing the night away in a tiny basement to the hot disco “hits” of the late 90s. God knows what time we finally got out of there. Needless to say, we all had a little lay-in the next morning.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Gigs</h2>\n<p><em>In 2009, without planning to, Katie and I visited St.Mary’s in the same week as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Pilot_Gig_Championships\">World Gig Pilot Gig Championships</a>…</em></p>\n<p>All week, St.Mary’s had been its usual, tranquil place: Little sailing boats had bobbed in the harbour; Gentle winds had blown across the sun-kissed beaches. And the island’s pubs and eateries had no queues at the bar or required bookings for dinner.</p>\n<p>That all changed on Friday morning when the Scillonian docked and brought ashore the first of the revellers who’d come to Scilly to enjoy the weekend’s racing. The Isles of Scilly Steamship Company runs the Scillonian twice-a-day on Gig weekends, dumping several thousand people on the islands in quick succession.</p>\n<p>The whole character of the island was transformed.

Experiencing this new aspect of Scilly was exciting. Everyone was very jolly, and even a weekend fuelled by alcohol and little sleep didn’t seem to dampen their enthusiasm for cheering on their team.</p>\n<p>If you’re not familiar, a Cornish Pilot Gig is a six-person boat about 10 meters long and 1.5 meters wide.

From the start line, they race across the clear stretch of water to St.Mary’s harbour.</p>\n<p>From our vantage point up on the Garrison, it looks pandemonium; oars churning the sea into a raging torrent. All around the Gigs are the island’s small ferry boats filled to bursting with spectators who’ve paid for the privilege of a close-up view. Add to this the hundreds of smaller private crafts, and you wonder how they don’t smash into each other.</p>\n<p>All around us, people are screaming at the top of their lungs, as if the object of their affection could actually hear them way out at sea. I wouldn’t be surprised if they could, such is the roar of the crowd.</p>\n<p>The shouting reached fever pitch as the first of the boats rounded the quay, finish line in sight. Given how long they’ve been racing the gap between them was astonishingly close. I’m not sure how they tell, but the first Gig to cross the finish line immediately started to celebrate. They must have been knackered, but somehow they found the strength to row the final few meters to Town Beach. Here, there’s a whole army of people to help them drag the Gig up onto the beach.</p>\n<p>(figure set:gigs,class:pull-both)</p>\n<p>Wanting to drink-in more of the atmosphere and a couple of the local ales, Katie and I headed to the Mermaid. This place is incredibly claustrophobic at the best of times, with memorabilia covering every inch of every available surface. Saturday evenings are particularly busy, but this was something else. We could see punters spilling out onto the pavement as we approached. The only way to get in was to forcibly push through the sweaty throng. I imagine as we introduced ourselves into the crush, two other people were ejected from another door somewhere. This place was full.</p>\n<p>Inside the beer was flowing. People were dancing on tables. Tall tales were being told of the day’s victories. Somehow we managed to get a seat, Katie on the end of a bench, and me perched awkwardly on a window ledge. What a night! We emerged several hours later, a little drunk and horse from trying to make ourselves heard.</p>\n<p>This is one of my favourite memories of the Islands. I felt totally immersed in the culture. Caught-up in something. It was a unique experience that I don’t think we could ever recapture. In a way, I wouldn’t want to. It was perfect, trying to get it back would somehow sully it.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Taking flight</h2>\n<p><em>In 2008, I took my first trip to the islands, and my first flight on a helicopter…</em></p>\n<p>There’s always a sadness that accompanies leaving the Isles of Scilly. It started for me this first year and has never diminished on subsequent trips. At least you used to be able to offset this with the excitement of a trip on the helicopter.</p>\n<p>After waving goodbye to our bags, which would be taken to the airport for us by Island Carriers, we headed into town. Now was the chance to buy as much <abbr title=\"Isles of Scilly\">IOS</abbr> branded tat as we could lay our grubby hands on. Of course, there was the Isles of Scilly tea towel; The Isles of Scilly fridge magnet; The Isles of Scilly puffin jigsaw; And the Isles of Scilly pencil and pencil sharpener deluxe set. Our friends and family were, understandably, delighted!</p>\n<p>Maxing-out your baggage allowance on a helicopter is surprisingly straightforward. We discovered this at check-in when both of our cases — now laden with souvenirs — were well over the 15 kg limit. Luckily the airport staff were as laid-back as every other islander we’d met, and waved us through.</p>\n<p>St.Mary’s Airport is by far the smallest terminal I’ve ever flown from. It’s miniature waiting area probably never any busier than it was now. A few people milled around, while others enjoyed hot drinks from styrofoam cups.</p>\n<p>When the time came, we were called into a small side room with the other passengers for our flight. Here, we were shown a short safety film from the late 80s. Then we heard it. A helicopter coming into land. The great throb-throb-throb of its propeller blades displacing the air.</p>\n<p>One of British International’s two <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikorsky_S-61\">Sikorsky S-61</a> helicopters landed with the slightest bounce. The side door flung open, and the passengers disembarked, ducking instinctively under the rotor blades.</p>\n<p>(figure set:helicopter,class:pull-both)</p>\n<p>Then it was our turn. Our air steward lead the way out onto the runway. We ducked under the rotors too, clinging desperately to lose items of clothing. Of course, we felt like rock stars.</p>\n<p>Once belts were fastened, the door was shut behind us with a reassuringly heavy click. Not that you can hear much above the roar of the engine, which now wound up ready for take-off. We felt an increase in the side-to-side wobble, and suddenly we were moving. The helicopter’s nose tipped forward and we swept up and along the runway. It’s exhilarating! The raw power that’s required to push this massive metal tube into the air must be immense. You feel every last joule of it.</p>\n<p>The view is spectacular. Passengers lucky enough to get window seats were furiously taking as many photos as they could. It’s too loud for conversation, so we just gesticulated to each other, pointing at things we recognised.</p>\n<p>Flying at 150 <abbr title=\"Miles Per Hour\">mph</abbr>, it only takes 20 minutes from St.Marys to Penzance. All too soon the islands disappeared over the horizon, and Lands End appeared in the port side windows. Moments later we were touching down at Penzance heliport.</p>\n<p>And that was that. Suddenly we were back to reality. Cars and people everywhere. Waiting for our bags, Katie asked me what I thought. She’d been extolling the virtues of Scilly since we’d met. “I’m in love”, I said. Or something like that. That’s the problem with memories, isn’t it? It’s sometimes hard to tell them apart from dreams.</p>\n"},{"date":"2013-07-02T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Sigur Ros at the Eden Project","section":"articles","tags":["music","capervanning","cornwall"],"cover":"/assets/blog/covers/sigur_ros_1.jpg","images":[{"image":"sigur_ros_1.jpg","caption":"Sigur Ros and their amazing light show","set":"sigur_1"},{"image":"sigur_ros_2.jpg","caption":"Eden's beautiful biomes at night","set":"sigur_2"}],"modifier":"dark","filename":"40","content":"<p>Katie and I are just back from a weekend in Cornwall with a few mates where we surfed, drank some <a href=\"http://www.tributeale.co.uk/\">great beer</a> and enjoyed the amazing Sigur Ros live at the Eden Project.</p>\n<p>Sigur Ros were one of those bands that had somehow passed me by so when our friend Tim suggested that we book tickets to see them I went more for the promise of surf than interest in the music.</p>\n<p>(figure set:sigur_2)</p>\n<p>We’d been to the <a href=\"http://www.edenproject.com/\">Eden Project</a> a few years before and I was really exited to go back.

It conjures images of far-flung island chains, sunkissed beaches and ragged shorelines. Twenty-eight miles off the southwestern tip of England is Cornwall’s own archipelago: The Isles of Scilly.</p>\n<p>The islands are a place of contrast. Beautiful yet wild. Bright white beaches nestle alongside sea ravaged cliffs. Windswept hills sit beside sheltered coves and inlets.</p>\n<p>My wife Katie and I have visited many times: With friends; As girlfriend and boyfriend; As husband and wife; And more recently, with our small family.</p>\n<p>This is my love letter to the Islands: A collection of memories from all those trips to Scilly. Out of order and somewhat idealised. The way good memories should be.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>The crossing</h2>\n<p><em>In 2012, Katie and I were due to fly via helicopter, alas it was grounded due to technical difficulty. We had to stay overnight in Penzance and catch the ferry the following day…</em></p>\n<p>Every morning, throughout the summer a passenger ferry departs from the quay in Penzance. Aboard you’ll find serval hundred seats, two cafés and thousands of small white bags in dispensers attached to the bulkheads.</p>\n<p>This is the <em><abbr title=\"Royal Mail Vessel\">RMV</abbr> Scillonian III</em>, and she’s been transporting excited — and occasionally green — tourists from the mainland to the Isles of Scilly since 1977.</p>\n<p>(figure set:scillonian,class:pull-both)</p>\n<p>There are more comfortable ways to get to the Scillies: A small seven-seater plane dubbed <em>Skybus</em> that flies from Lands End, Newquay or Exeter. And, in times past, there was a helicopter that flew from Penzance that was always our favourite way to get to the islands. Alas, this ceased operation at the end of 2012. We were booked on a mid-morning flight, but due to there being a large hole in the side of the helicopter, we were forced to overnight in a nearby hotel to catch the ferry the following day.</p>\n<p>On this particular voyage, we secured our regular spot on the middle deck, near the back door. This is the ideal spot for Katie to sit as motionless as possible and endure any rough crossing.</p>\n<p>Knowing the best thing to do is leave her alone, this position also avails me of an escape route outside to the upper deck. From here, it’s not unusual to spot gigantic shoals of fish or even dolphins in the wake of the engines. In rough water, this is also the optimal location to enjoy the power of the seas. And to keep a weathered eye on the horizon, just in case.</p>\n<p>At capacity, the Scillonian carries 485 souls some of whom line the upper deck like birds on a telephone wire. It’s a busy place to be, people perched atop benches, leaning on the rigging, or hanging over the rails.</p>\n<p>Whatever may come, we’re all now locked together for the two-hours and forty-five-minute trip. Knowing looks are passed over the heads of the unsuspecting day trippers by those of us who’ve travelled this way before. “Poor sods” our brief eye contact seems to say, as we don our pressure point travel bands and pop an array of chemical remedies for <em>mal de mare</em>.</p>\n<p>Luckily, all this preparation is for nought. Once we rounded Gwennap Head off Lands End, and are in full steam towards the islands, most of the more unpleasant effects of the sea are behind us. On a sunny day, there’s no better way to arrive on Scilly than by boat.</p>\n<p>What’s astonishing is the speed at which the passengers disappear once we’ve docked in St Mary’s harbour. Some hang around on the quay waiting for smaller tender boats to the off-islands. Most make the happy walk up the dock, past the Mermaid pub and along Hugh Street, draining off down the various alleyways and lanes to their holiday accommodations.</p>\n<p>At any one time throughout the summer there are thousands of visitors on the islands. And yet, it doesn’t ever feel busy. Scilly is full of secret places, quiet beaches and deserted coves.</p>\n<p>Our journey took us via the <a href=\"https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g488312-d1168609-Reviews-Kavorna_Cafe_Bistro-St_Mary_s_Isles_of_Scilly_England.html\">Kavorna Café</a> (to pick up our first Cornish pasty of the holiday), over Garrison Lane and onto Littleporth to where our friend’s mum has a place that looks out over Porthcressa beach.</p>\n<p>(figure set:view,class:pull-both)</p>\n<p>Naturally, the door is unlocked. Unloading our bags in the doorway, we made our way through the house and out into the garden. Finally, we sank into various bits of unmatched garden furniture and savoured our pasties in silence, taking in the gorgeous view, ready for our holiday to start.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>A lovely day for boating</h2>\n<p><em>In 2017, my wife Katie, daughter “Roo” and I visited Scilly along with our friends Cath and Dave…</em></p>\n<p>“Mummy! I want to get up now!”</p>\n<p>I turned over and looked at my watch. 8:05. Wow, she slept well.</p>\n<p>“Daddy!”</p>\n<p>OK, kid, give me a minute here. But Katie’s already out of bed and padding down the creaky corridor.</p>\n<p>“Shh, you’ll wake Cath and Dave”, I hear Katie tell <em>Roo</em>. Rolling over I caught a glimpse of the sun streaming in at the window. Time to get up.</p>\n<p>“Mummy, we on holy-day”,  <em>Roo</em> confidently tells Katie as they, by degrees, make their way down the corridor. Katie was taking significantly more care than <em>Roo</em>, who skipped down the hall like a demented rabbit.</p>\n<p>I joined my family in the Kitchen. It really was a gorgeous day. A quick check of the BBC’s weather app informed me that it’s a balmy twenty-five degrees with light winds. A lovely day for boating.</p>\n<p>After breakfast we executed our plan: Heading for St Martins. Five of us; intrepid seafarers standing on the quay, tickets in hand watching the <em>Sea King</em> draw alongside the waiting passengers.</p>\n<p>(figure set:seaking,class:pull-both)</p>\n<p>Landing at Higher Town, our first port of call was <a href=\"http://www.theislandbakery-stmartins.com/\">The Island Bakery</a> for the day’s supplies. Fully stocked with Cornish pasties and cola cake, we trundled up the single track road and over the brow of the hill before taking the path cut through a field overgrown with Scilly’s ubiquitous Bracken. The vast swathe of white sand of Great Bay was almost deserted. Besides a few families lounging here and there we’re the only people, so finding a sheltered spot was simple.</p>\n<p>(figure set:digging,class:pull-left)</p>\n<p>Seaside days used to be a relaxed affair but with <em>Roo</em> in tow, it’s now more like mobilising a beach assault. Once the shelter was up, beach mats laid out and sun cream applied, we unpacked the various excavating tools. Thankfully she’s still a bit too small to want to bury daddy, so digging giant holes was the order of the day. <em>Roo</em> took up her position as site foreman then Dave, and I set about our task of digging several large holes and interconnecting trenches. Eventually, the tide will come up and fill this carefully engineered system, much to <em>Roo’s</em> delight, after which Dave and I will have to frantically shore-up walls and rebuild various dams.</p>\n<p>All too soon the site whistle sounds for lunch.</p>\n<p>“Lads! Lunchtime!”</p>\n<p>Sated, crumb covered, and chocolate stained we emerged from lunch. If only <em>Roo</em> can have a nap in the beach shelter, maybe we can have a relaxing hour catching up on some reading. She doesn’t take much coaxing, exhausted from bossing us around she’s happy to sleep.</p>\n<p>One or two of us drifted off too. It’s hard not to in the warmth of the day and with the rhythmic whoosh of the sea lapping at the beach. On waking, I felt the need to burn off all that pasty. It’s was time to break out the wetsuit and snorkel and explore the crystal clear waters.</p>\n<p>Wetsuit, booties, flippers, mask and flippers. All the gear and no idea. Penguin-like, I gingerly waddled my way down to the shoreline and into the freezing waters of the Atlantic. Once waist-deep, I took a big breath and rolled forward into the water. Waiting for the cold water effect to pass, I wrangled the mask into position over my face and entered the underwater world.</p>\n<p>Below the water barrier, I’m in another world entirely. From the beach, I must look like Manatee in distress, but down in my aquatic environment, I felt like Jacques Cousteau about to discover some previously unimagined species.</p>\n<p>Further out the water was clear all the way to the bottom some five meters below, where Kelp forests sheltered shoals of fish. A sudden shot of panic as my lizard brain picked up movement in my peripheral vision: A large striped fish darted out of the Kelp. I followed at a distance. He came to rest in a clearing, and I was able to float above him and just watch for what seemed like an eternity.</p>\n<p>(figure set:snorkel,class:pull-both)</p>\n<p>“I saw a <em>massive</em> fish out there”, I announced to Katie, extending my arms to demonstrate its size, adding a few centimetres in the tradition of men everywhere when talking about the size of things.</p>\n<p>“That’s nice dear”, she replied. “But we need to pack up and go, or we’ll miss the last boat back.”</p>\n<p>Everyone was contemplative on the return to St Mary’s. Even <em>Roo</em> — who was up on her knees so she could see over the side — was uncharacteristically quiet. It was hard not to get lost in that view; the ocean glinting like a blanket of tiny diamonds, the twin islands of St. Agnes and Gugh slung low on the horizon.</p>\n<p><em>Roo</em> was asleep as soon as her head hit the pillow. Perfect, especially as Dave and Cath had kindly offered to babysit.</p>\n<p>A great tradition on our visits to Scilly — perhaps <em>the</em> tradition — is partaking in a scone or two at <a href=\"http://www.julietsgardenrestaurant.co.uk/\">Juliet’s Garden</a>. Perched on top of a hill, the garden offers spectacular views over Tresco. On a warm day, there’s nothing quite like sitting in Juliet’s Garden cramming copious amounts of scone and tea into ones face.</p>\n<p>(figure set:juliets,class:span-both)</p>\n<p>Juliet isn’t just famed for her cream teas, she also runs a fantastic restaurant. On arrival this evening, Katie and I were served drinks in the garden while watching the gorgeous sunset. Then, taking our seats inside, we were treated to an incredible three-course meal.</p>\n<p>As the evening was warm, and our bellies were full we decided to forego a taxi and walk. We sat a while on the flat rock above Town Beach and watched the boat lights bobbing around in the harbour. I don’t think either of us wanted the evening to end. Eventually, though, the lure of bed called us, and we reluctantly slunk back to the house. I often think of that romantic evening on the flat rock as one of my stand out memories of our trip that year. For me, a balmy evening watching small boats on the water <em>is</em> quintessentially Scilly.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>The Scilly Cart, Co.</h2>\n<p><em>In 2014, on our last holiday, before Roo was born, we visited Scilly with our friends Cath, Dave and Emily.</em></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.scillycart.co/\">Scilly Cart Co </a> used to have a Facebook page on which it posted pictures, usually taken by disgruntled locals, of the imperfect parking decisions taken by tourists when hiring a cart for the day. When you arrive at the Cart Co’s depot, you’re greeted with a display board of these photos followed by a pep-talk by the owner on the evils of annoying the locals with where you choose to park.</p>\n<p>(figure set:cart,class:pull-left)</p>\n<p>With these words of warning rising in our ears Dave and I pulled out onto the main road, each of us determined to follow the rules to the letter. How we ended up attempting to break the land-speed record is anyone’s guess. One moment we were driving along sensibly, the next we were bouncing up and down in our seats trying to squeeze every ounce of speed we could from our formula-z cart. Needless to say, we weren’t very successful, and no traffic laws were violated.</p>\n<p>After the girls were aboard, we set out along the Telegraph Road that circles the innards of the island. There was no plan beyond maybe finding a beach and most definitely finding somewhere for lunch. I’ve gotta admit that — despite appearances — driving a golf-buggy is crazy fun. So we kept driving, twice around the island in fact, before we eventually decided we needed some lunch.</p>\n<p>This was the birth of another great tradition: Lunch at <a href=\"http://www.scillycountryhouse.com/about-us/kaffeehaus/\">Kaffeehaus Salbei</a>, a German-inspired café and guesthouse. When it’s hot, and not too busy, you can get a table outside or else swelter inside the conservatory. The German Platter is a must, with homemade bread and Bavarian meats and cheeses. Then, of course, one must have either the Apfelstrudel or — my personal favourite — a slice of Sacher Torte. I swear the cart was noticeably slower after lunch. It was either the weight of the food, or the battery had taken a beating from our multiple laps of the island.</p>\n<p>Locals on the islands often supplement their income by making things, which are offered for sale by the side of the road. An honesty box is provided for you to remunerate the artist for their handiwork. There is such a place on Porth Loo Lane. With time on our hands, we parked the cart and went for a look.</p>\n<p>(figure set:fox,class:pull-right)</p>\n<p>This particular treasure-trove was in the craftsperson’s garden shed. Inside, we found all manner of items. Some cobbled together from flotsam and jetsam. Some reclaimed from household bits and bobs. One thing, in particular, caught Dave’s eye: A fox, made from an old piece of brown carpet. One mad button eye was sewn onto its face, another for its nose. It was beautiful. It was perfect. He had to have it. I think it is a source of great regret that he didn’t buy it there and then. We should have known really, but when we returned later it was already gone. I like to think of it in an ornamental frame, in pride of place above someone’s fireplace. Lucky buggers.</p>\n<p>Later, the cart safely returned with minimal damage, we headed to the Atlantic for dinner and the pub quiz. We were all too drunk (or too stupid) to answer any of the questions well, and “team bum trumpets” inevitably place dead last.</p>\n<p>On any other evening, a night-out on Scilly would end with the closing of the pub. But not tonight, tonight we were off to Barry’s.</p>\n<p>Once a week, Barry opens the doors to his basement for the world famous Barry’s Disco. Imagine the scene: 50 sweaty people dancing the night away in a tiny basement to the hot disco “hits” of the late 90s. God knows what time we finally got out of there. Needless to say, we all had a little lay-in the next morning.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Gigs</h2>\n<p><em>In 2009, without planning to, Katie and I visited St.Mary’s in the same week as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Pilot_Gig_Championships\">World Gig Pilot Gig Championships</a>…</em></p>\n<p>All week, St.Mary’s had been its usual, tranquil place: Little sailing boats had bobbed in the harbour; Gentle winds had blown across the sun-kissed beaches. And the island’s pubs and eateries had no queues at the bar or required bookings for dinner.</p>\n<p>That all changed on Friday morning when the Scillonian docked and brought ashore the first of the revellers who’d come to Scilly to enjoy the weekend’s racing. The Isles of Scilly Steamship Company runs the Scillonian twice-a-day on Gig weekends, dumping several thousand people on the islands in quick succession.</p>\n<p>The whole character of the island was transformed. Pubs, who’d obtained exclusive licences for the occasion, remained open 24-hours a day for the duration. There was a not-so-small minority of people who were here for the weekend, but hadn’t anywhere to stay, electing instead to spend their entire time in the boozer.</p>\n<p>This didn’t dent the enjoyment, far from it. Experiencing this new aspect of Scilly was exciting. Everyone was very jolly, and even a weekend fuelled by alcohol and little sleep didn’t seem to dampen their enthusiasm for cheering on their team.</p>\n<p>If you’re not familiar, a Cornish Pilot Gig is a six-person boat about 10 meters long and 1.5 meters wide. In addition to the six rowers, a Cox steers and shouts encouragement and is responsible for ensuring the crew makes land before last orders.</p>\n<p>Gigs are a common sight on the Scillies. Their names, like “Slippen”, “Bonnet” and “Nornour” pay homage to the memory of their namesakes who, in the 17th and 18th centuries, were used as transfer vessels to take Pilots out to larger ships. A Pilot was a local sailor who could navigate safely through the treacherous, rock-laden waters of the archipelago.</p>\n<p>We got chatting with a man in a pub. A misty-eyed old sea dog. He told us that it was often the case that more than one Pilot was available at any one time, and the first man to arrive would get the job. So the Gig crews took to racing, the fastest sailors would get paid, and that’s how the Gig races on the Isles started. It’s a romantic story, and I’d like to believe it’s true.</p>\n<p>The races start out at sea. The officials string a line buoys to form a start line out by Nut Rock. The crews then wait in their boats as close to the start line as they can. But woe betides any vessel that crosses the line before “go” is called. They get instantly disqualified.</p>\n<p>There are old rivalries and alliances between teams who come from all over the world. These all go out of the window once the call comes to start. Every crew for themselves. A crew of six, pulling for all their worth. From the start line, they race across the clear stretch of water to St.Mary’s harbour.</p>\n<p>From our vantage point up on the Garrison, it looks pandemonium; oars churning the sea into a raging torrent. All around the Gigs are the island’s small ferry boats filled to bursting with spectators who’ve paid for the privilege of a close-up view. Add to this the hundreds of smaller private crafts, and you wonder how they don’t smash into each other.</p>\n<p>All around us, people are screaming at the top of their lungs, as if the object of their affection could actually hear them way out at sea. I wouldn’t be surprised if they could, such is the roar of the crowd.</p>\n<p>The shouting reached fever pitch as the first of the boats rounded the quay, finish line in sight. Given how long they’ve been racing the gap between them was astonishingly close. I’m not sure how they tell, but the first Gig to cross the finish line immediately started to celebrate. They must have been knackered, but somehow they found the strength to row the final few meters to Town Beach. Here, there’s a whole army of people to help them drag the Gig up onto the beach.</p>\n<p>(figure set:gigs,class:pull-both)</p>\n<p>Wanting to drink-in more of the atmosphere and a couple of the local ales, Katie and I headed to the Mermaid. This place is incredibly claustrophobic at the best of times, with memorabilia covering every inch of every available surface. Saturday evenings are particularly busy, but this was something else. We could see punters spilling out onto the pavement as we approached. The only way to get in was to forcibly push through the sweaty throng. I imagine as we introduced ourselves into the crush, two other people were ejected from another door somewhere. This place was full.</p>\n<p>Inside the beer was flowing. People were dancing on tables. Tall tales were being told of the day’s victories. Somehow we managed to get a seat, Katie on the end of a bench, and me perched awkwardly on a window ledge. What a night! We emerged several hours later, a little drunk and horse from trying to make ourselves heard.</p>\n<p>This is one of my favourite memories of the Islands. I felt totally immersed in the culture. Caught-up in something. It was a unique experience that I don’t think we could ever recapture. In a way, I wouldn’t want to. It was perfect, trying to get it back would somehow sully it.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Taking flight</h2>\n<p><em>In 2008, I took my first trip to the islands, and my first flight on a helicopter…</em></p>\n<p>There’s always a sadness that accompanies leaving the Isles of Scilly. It started for me this first year and has never diminished on subsequent trips. At least you used to be able to offset this with the excitement of a trip on the helicopter.</p>\n<p>After waving goodbye to our bags, which would be taken to the airport for us by Island Carriers, we headed into town. Now was the chance to buy as much <abbr title=\"Isles of Scilly\">IOS</abbr> branded tat as we could lay our grubby hands on. Of course, there was the Isles of Scilly tea towel; The Isles of Scilly fridge magnet; The Isles of Scilly puffin jigsaw; And the Isles of Scilly pencil and pencil sharpener deluxe set. Our friends and family were, understandably, delighted!</p>\n<p>Maxing-out your baggage allowance on a helicopter is surprisingly straightforward. We discovered this at check-in when both of our cases — now laden with souvenirs — were well over the 15 kg limit. Luckily the airport staff were as laid-back as every other islander we’d met, and waved us through.</p>\n<p>St.Mary’s Airport is by far the smallest terminal I’ve ever flown from. It’s miniature waiting area probably never any busier than it was now. A few people milled around, while others enjoyed hot drinks from styrofoam cups.</p>\n<p>When the time came, we were called into a small side room with the other passengers for our flight. Here, we were shown a short safety film from the late 80s. Then we heard it. A helicopter coming into land. The great throb-throb-throb of its propeller blades displacing the air.</p>\n<p>One of British International’s two <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikorsky_S-61\">Sikorsky S-61</a> helicopters landed with the slightest bounce. The side door flung open, and the passengers disembarked, ducking instinctively under the rotor blades.</p>\n<p>(figure set:helicopter,class:pull-both)</p>\n<p>Then it was our turn. Our air steward lead the way out onto the runway. We ducked under the rotors too, clinging desperately to lose items of clothing. Of course, we felt like rock stars.</p>\n<p>Once belts were fastened, the door was shut behind us with a reassuringly heavy click. Not that you can hear much above the roar of the engine, which now wound up ready for take-off. We felt an increase in the side-to-side wobble, and suddenly we were moving. The helicopter’s nose tipped forward and we swept up and along the runway. It’s exhilarating! The raw power that’s required to push this massive metal tube into the air must be immense. You feel every last joule of it.</p>\n<p>The view is spectacular. Passengers lucky enough to get window seats were furiously taking as many photos as they could. It’s too loud for conversation, so we just gesticulated to each other, pointing at things we recognised.</p>\n<p>Flying at 150 <abbr title=\"Miles Per Hour\">mph</abbr>, it only takes 20 minutes from St.Marys to Penzance. All too soon the islands disappeared over the horizon, and Lands End appeared in the port side windows. Moments later we were touching down at Penzance heliport.</p>\n<p>And that was that. Suddenly we were back to reality. Cars and people everywhere. Waiting for our bags, Katie asked me what I thought. She’d been extolling the virtues of Scilly since we’d met. “I’m in love”, I said. Or something like that. That’s the problem with memories, isn’t it? It’s sometimes hard to tell them apart from dreams.</p>\n"}]},{"name":"leading design conference","count":1,"items":[{"title":"Some thoughts on design leadership","tags":["leading design conference","design","design leadership","barbican","conferences"],"date":"2017-10-30T00:00:00.000Z","filename":"67","content":"<p>I spent some of last week listening to some great design leaders share their thoughts at <a href=\"https://2017.leadingdesignconf.com/\">Leading Design 2017</a>.

Its obvious that were all thinking about patterns, and particularly how Sketch symbols have enabled a new workflow.</p>\n<p>Later, we moved on to a workshop session where we mapped out our design process and made a (long) list of all the tools we were currently using day-to-day.</p>\n<p>(figure set:tuna)</p>\n<p>What was clear is that there are a <em>lot</em> of design tools out there. Sketch is ubiquitous, having quickly proved its value against creaky Adobe tools. However, there’s a whole ecosystem of other tools that are designed to fill gaps in the designers workflow.</p>\n<p>Having both a design and front-end development background I feel like I’ve seen this all before. There have been several “revolutions” in web — <abbr title=\"Cascading Style Sheets\">CSS</abbr>, Responsiveness, HTMLinJS, etc —  that all gave rise to any number of tools that promised “more time doing what you love.”</p>\n<p>Some of these tools were flash in the pan: When they didn’t find traction amongst enough developers, they died. However, they each added their voices to the shared knowledge amongst developers on <em>how</em> to develop for the web.</p>\n<p>As it is now with design tools. Sure, some of them don’t really know what they’re trying to be, but can we blame them? We don’t know what we need right now. Ultimately what matters is the thinking behind patterns not how we build them.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, if you’re designing sites for the web or apps for devices, then eventually someone with a bit of coding nounce has to translate your designs into the real deal. Regardless of whether the ultimate destination of your design is HTML, Swift or <em>whatever</em>, I’d argue that designing with patterns in mind — no matter of the size of project — helps you think more like a developer. You’ll have better conversations with your developer friends and this will lead to a better experience for your users.</p>\n<p>Patterns is a way of thinking about design, rather than a set of tools. You could just as easily apply this thinking to MS Paint. But what the tools give us is a way to explore, as a community, what works best.</p>\n<p>I personally welcome the slew of tools even if they are pretty immature right now. There’s a really smart community of designers out there that’ll direct tool makers leading us all to a brighter future.

Designers have long had the idea of designing interfaces from a kit of pre-built parts, but never really had the tools to do this effectively. Sketch is such a tool.</p>\n<p>At Firefly, we’ve recently made the transition to Sketch specifically because of the power of symbols. These have enabled us to build our pattern library in a way that helps us to do some extremely rapid prototyping and create consistent experiences for our users.</p>\n<p>Our Front-End and iOS teams already have their own pattern libraries. These are different, partly due to technical reasons, but there’s another reason we kept the patterns separate. As we continue to strive for feature parity between platforms, its obvious that there are some fundamental differences between web and iOS.  There is a <em>way</em> of doing things in iOS — interactions that users expect — that’s different from the web. Hence, web and iOS have the same features, but implemented in the way that makes the most sense to users of that platform.</p>\n<p>Our dream was to create two design pattern libraries that would contain the same elements as the web and iOS libraries. This would mean that we’d all be working from the same list of patterns, rather than adding a translation step when it came to implementation.</p>\n<h2>Structure</h2>\n<p>We studied the structure of the existing pattern libraries and created a map that included all patterns, their modifiers and states. This gave us the structure for our patterns, and a place to start from when translating programatic patterns into something that would be useable in Sketch.</p>\n<p>In simple terms, our pattern library is a number of Sketch files containing — as symbols — all the elements in the Firefly interface. We divide these into separate files, one for each platform. We’ve also broken web into web-core and one file for each of our <a href=\"http://themes.fireflylearning.com\">four core themes</a>.</p>\n<p>In each of the files, we’ve categorised our symbols into areas. This helps massively with your mental model when browsing the symbols page. This also allows us to print a visual style-guide of all our patterns.</p>\n<p>(figure set:categorising,class:poke-both)</p>\n<h2>Symbols</h2>\n<p>Sketch supports symbol nesting and overrides. This makes symbols extremely powerful. This allows you to create a pattern element by combining symbols together.</p>\n<p>However, organisation is everything. If you don’t follow a systematic approach to creating patterns, they’re extremely difficult to use in the wild. We know from experience that confusion arises about which symbols are patterns, and which are simply the building blocks of patterns. Let me explain…</p>\n<h3>Parts and Patterns</h3>\n<p>(figure set:button-anatomy,class:pull-right)</p>\n<p>A pattern is made up of either parts or other symbols. Each part is a symbol. A Button, for example, is made up of two parts <em>Background</em> and <em>Label</em>, and another pattern <em>Icon</em>. We use <a href=\"https://www.sketchapp.com/learn/documentation/symbols/organizing-symbols/\">slash notation</a> to organise parts and patterns under one namespace.</p>\n<p>(figure set:dropdown,class:poke-both)</p>\n<p>Organising our symbols this way makes it easy when using a pattern. It’s immediately obvious from the list of symbols which is a pattern that’s intended for use, and which are just the building blocks of patterns.</p>\n<h3>Using Patterns in the wild</h3>\n<p>When designing a new feature, we’ll start out with a blank sketch file. Let’s say, for example, that we wanted a very simple interface that required two buttons: OK and Cancel. OK needs to be a cancel type with a tick icon, and Cancel needs to be a default type with a cross icon.</p>\n<p>In our pattern library file, we have a page called <em>scratch</em> where we can set up a pattern ready to be copied into another file. We select the <code>Button &gt; Patterns &gt; Button with Icon Left</code> symbol from the list and drop it into our scratch page. We can then use the symbol overrides to change it’s Background, Icon and Label as required. We can also override the text.</p>\n<p>(figure set:using-a-symbol,class:poke-both)</p>\n<p>Once the pattern is set up, we can then copy this into the new document. This only copies the parts required for this instance of the pattern. So trying to change the symbol overrides in the new file won’t work until you copy over all variations of a pattern.</p>\n<h2>Tips ’n tricks</h2>\n<p>There’s a few areas where symbols are ripe for improvement. Given Bohemian’s track record for updates and bug fixes I suspect these can’t be too far off. Meantime, there’s a couple of workarounds that we’ve found particularly useful that I’d like to share.</p>\n<h3>Pin to corner</h3>\n<p>The ability to change resize behaviour in symbols is extremely useful. However, the “Pin to corner” option is somewhat limited as it doesn’t let you specify <em>which</em> corner.</p>\n<p>(figure set:pintocorner,class:pull-right)</p>\n<p>We solve this by simply grouping a transparent shape in with the layer we wish to align. This allows you pin to other corners than the one that Sketch might have automatically picked for you.</p>\n<h3>Override colours of icons</h3>\n<p>It’s annoying to have to have separate symbols for different icon colours. Especially when adding a new colour, meaning you have to create a new symbol for all the icons in the new colour.</p>\n<p>Luckily, we can use layer masks and overrides to easily add colour options. An Icon pattern is actually a grouped rectangle masked out by the icon shape. We are then able to control the icon type <em>and</em> colour from a pre-defined pallet of colours. Adding a new colour is as easy as adding a new icon mask symbol.</p>\n<p>(figure set:overridecolour,class:poke-both)</p>\n<p>Another small tip: Make your icons and masks different sizes, that way you won’t get shown all the icons and colours together in the overrides dropdown.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Sharing patterns</h2>\n<p>So far I’ve not really touched on how we’re using our pattern library across a team. An essential part of any pattern library is its use beyond a single person. When we set out to create our pattern library, we had a simple set of requirements:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Symbols should be stored in a central location that is accessible by the whole team</li>\n<li>Symbols can be linked across files, updating a symbol in any file updates it everywhere</li>\n<li>Editing clashes are handled in a nice way</li>\n<li>Symbols can be organised into categories</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>What we’re currently doing</h3>\n<p>Initially we experimented with <a href=\"https://www.invisionapp.com/craft\">Craft</a> from inVision. It’s library functionality would allow us to store symbols in a central location, share them across the team. Most excitingly of all, symbols would be linked across files, meaning we could ensure we were always using the latest version in our designs.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, when it came to handling editing clashes, Craft did less well. We lost an entire week of work due to our library file becoming corrupted. We were told that this was a known issue, and the file was unrecoverable. We decided not to entrust our entire pattern library to Craft, there was no way we could risk that happening again.</p>\n<p>We switched to using Sketch files themselves to contain our patterns. A downside to this solution was that editing clashes weren’t handled, at all. Rather, whoever saved the file last would overwrite work of anyone else. Thankfully, <a href=\"https://abstractapp.com/\">Abstract</a> came to our rescue.</p>\n<p>The team has been using Abstract for version management of Sketch files for the last few weeks, and what a difference it’s made! Once you have the git mental model in your head, Abstract’s workflow makes a lot of sense. We can now branch off the master pattern library document, make our changes, and merge back. Clashes are handled visually, giving you the choice of which symbol definition to keep.</p>\n<p>(figure set:abstarct,class:poke-both)</p>\n<p>We now have three out of four of our original requirements. We’re almost there! But what about linking symbols across files?</p>\n<h2>A native solution?</h2>\n<p>I’d argue that level of complexity represented by shared symbols in Sketch requires a native solution. Plugins, like Craft, will only ever be a poly-fill at best.</p>\n<p>Looking at the features that Bohemian have added to Sketch over the last few versions, I strongly suspect that they’re already planning shared symbols. It’s a natural fit for them, they already have the cloud infrastructure from Sketch Cloud and with their new open JSON formatted files, it seems like this might be the next logical step.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Are you looking for a new design challenge in London?

This time I’m going to talk about some the front-end technology and practices we used to help us build more robust software.</p>\n<h2>We built a pattern library</h2>\n<p>Until Firefly 6, it was usual practice to build features one-by-one. There was little re-use of code, meaning if we found a bug with an element, then we’d have to fix it multiple times.</p>\n<p>What we needed was a pattern library! In October we were joined for a few days by Anna Debenham who literally wrote the book on <a href=\"http://www.maban.co.uk/projects/front-end-style-guides/\">front-end style guides</a> to help us catalogue Firefly’s user interface.</p>\n<p>(figure set:anna)</p>\n<p>We used this to build a “single source of truth” library of interface elements. This means that Firefly is now essentially built from a kit of parts. If we need a button, we can just call one in from the library. Even better, if we find a bug with the button, we can fix it once, and its fixed everywhere. Much faster and a lot more robust.</p>\n<p>I also have to mention <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniellehuntrods/\">Danielle Huntrods</a>, a contractor who worked with us for almost a year, during which she built the majority of the of the pattern library. It was her brilliance that gave us such a solid foundation for the future.</p>\n<p>We plan (at some point) to release a publicly accessible version of the pattern library. This is part of our ongoing commitment to openness and giving back to the web community. Hopefully others will find what we’ve done useful.</p>\n<h2>We flattened the cascade</h2>\n<p>Cascading Style Sheets, or CSS, is the language that allows us to define the visual appearance of web pages. Firefly uses quite a lot of it.</p>\n<p>CSS uses something called a “Cascade”, meaning that elements can inherit their style from other elements that use the same HTML. For example:</p>\n<pre><code>button {\n    background-color: blue;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Means all <code>button</code> elements on the page would have a blue background.</p>\n<p>However if you wanted to make one red, you can give it a name, and use that name in the CSS to override the background colour to red. Useful and straightforward enough.</p>\n<p>However, The problem with this comes when you have thousands of elements. Sometimes, when you style one element, because of the way CSS cascades, you inadvertently style another element you didn’t mean to.</p>\n<p>We solve this at Firefly by using a way of writing CSS called BEM, or Block Element Modifier. This allows us to effectively remove the cascade by using a naming system that guarantees that  you only ever style the specific element you meant to.</p>\n<p>This is great for us at Firefly, as it means we ship far less styling bugs. And it makes it easy for us to fix those bugs that do slip through, knowing that we’re not going to accidentally  cause more bugs elsewhere.</p>\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/\">read more about BEM here</a>, on the excellent CSS Tricks website.</p>\n<h2>We became more Reactive</h2>\n<p>Firefly makes heavy use of the other great language of the web: Javascript. This is the technology that allows us to manipulate the interface in real-time, without having to reload the page every time you take any action within Firefly.</p>\n<p>To help us write better Javascript, we’ve stared using a library called <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/react/\">React</a>. React was developed by Facebook to solve some of the challenges they were facing when building their website.</p>\n<p>To understand why this is good for Firefly, lets look at a practical example of a feature we introduced in Firefly 5: The Markbook.</p>\n<p>The Markbook is a highly interactive screen with lots of different states. We use Javascript to manage these states. However, this is where things get complicated very quickly. The developer must remember to update <em>all</em> the states when the user interacts with <em>any</em> of the states.</p>\n<p>For example, opening one popup will need to close any others. As you add more and more states, this compounds the problem. This is the source of many bugs, as developers can’t keep all these things in their heads all at once.</p>\n<p>(figure set:markbook)</p>\n<p>React manages states for you, by keeping its own internal copy of the page’s HTML, (what’s known as the Document Object Model, or DOM). It continually compares <em>its</em> model  to the real DOM that’s shown to the user, and updates it on the fly.</p>\n<p>In this way, things like closing one popup when another is opening can be controlled by one simple rule, and React handles the rest. This is leads to less bugs and happier users.</p>\n<p>We make use of React in the new Task Details screen, where teachers can mark student’s work in a variety of ways. This screen has hundreds of different states, all managed reliably by React.</p>\n<h2>We simplified our themes offering</h2>\n<p>This was perhaps the most controversial changes we made with made in Firefly 6. We did this to improve the user experience of the majority of users in Firefly, but quite understandably some schools were disgruntled when they discovered that we were retiring Columnist and Angular. We were also removed support for a number of custom themes we’d built for some of our long-standing clients.</p>\n<h3>Fewer bugs</h3>\n<p>Themes have always been the source of front-end bugs within Firefly. Each theme has its own HTML with which it “wraps” standard Firefly elements (like resource page content, or the Markbook for example). It also has its own CSS with which it will restyle the standard Firefly elements.</p>\n<p>This means that when we release new feature or updates existing ones, we also have to update the themes. The more themes, the more updates we have to do. Obviously, this model doesn’t scale well. So we’ve reduced the number of themes we offer to ensure that when we release updates, we can ensure that all our schools have a great experience.</p>\n<h3>Theme Variables</h3>\n<p>What about theme customisation? Many schools want to inject their personality into the tools they use every day. In Firefly 5 we introduced <strong>Theme Variables</strong> to do just this. We improved them in Firefly 6 (more about that later), but its worth covering the basics:</p>\n<p>Firefly uses a CSS pre-processor called <em><a href=\"http://lesscss.org/\">Less</a></em>. This allows us to store colours as variables, and manipulate them programatically. For example, Melody has a variable called <code>@background-colour</code>, thats used in different places throughout the interface. <em>Less</em> allows you to use an array of <a href=\"http://lesscss.org/functions/#color-operations\">colour operation functions</a> to do things like darken or lighten colours. This is particularly useful for creating a harmonious colour scheme.</p>\n<p>We also use <em>Less</em> to check the relative contrast between two colours. For example, lets say we have a box, styled like this:</p>\n<pre><code>.box {\n    background-colour: @background-colour;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>We’d want to check that any text that’s put inside that box is legible. We can do this with <em>Less</em> by checking the contrast of two alternative colours <em>against</em> a background colour, and using the one which is most legible, like so:</p>\n<pre><code>.box {\n    background-colour: @background-colour;\n    color: contrast(@background-colour, black, white);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>All of which means that, per school, we can override these core variables with school colours, and be assured that the interface will still look great, and all text will be legible.</p>\n<h3>Better theme options</h3>\n<p>We’ve done a lot of work in Firefly 6 to improve and streamline the Theme Variables. Each theme now only requires a small set of colours. Every other colour used within the interface is based-off this core set.</p>\n<p>We’ve also removed a number of theme options that weren’t really adding much value for schools. For instance, lots of schools told us that they didn’t really care about things like background patterns, or changing fonts. We now use smart defaults instead.</p>\n<p>We’ve paved the way to style more of the interface based-off the schools’ colour choices in the future, all in a way that will work with feature updates we make.</p>\n<h2>Wrapping up</h2>\n<p>I hope you’ve found these couple of articles interesting. We like to be as open as possible about the way we build software. Hopefully this has given you an insight into the internal workings here at Firefly, and the things we’ve done to ensure we’re delivering the absolute best product possible.</p>\n"},{"title":"The road to Firefly 6, part 1","date":"2017-01-16T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["Firefly","design"],"images":[{"image":"big-red-button.jpg","caption":"Robin, Viv and I gather around the beautifully designed button to activate Firefly 6 in our offices in Hammersmith, 12th December 2016","set":"A"},{"image":"me-user-testing.jpg","caption":"Me doing some user testing at the Firefly Learning Conference in Birmingham, November 2016","set":"testing"},{"image":"sketching.jpg","caption":"An early sketch from a sketching workshop we ran at  the Firefly offices","set":"testing"},{"image":"team-firefly.jpg","caption":"Almost all of Team Firefly at the Firefly Learning Conference in Birmingham, 15th November 2016","set":"team"},{"image":"office-1.jpg","caption":"Firefly’s new offices at the Aircraft Factory, Hammersmith.","set":"office"},{"image":"office-2.jpg","caption":"Joe’s old Raleigh Firefly bike in pride of place at the Firefly offices in Hammersmith, October 2016","set":"office"}],"filename":"59","content":"<p>Recently, Robin, Viv and I had the honour of pushing the (literal) big red button that would enable our clients to upgrade to Firefly 6. Champaign corks were popped and pizza was enjoyed by the whole team before we, very quickly, very diligently, returned to work.</p>\n<p>(figure set:A)</p>\n<p>Now seems like a good point to pause, and look back on the past eighteen months and the changes we made to our team, technology and working practices that enabled us to release the biggest step-change in Firefly to date.</p>\n<p>I’ve broken this article into two parts: This first part starts with journey in time from the deep dark past of April 2015 right up to the present day. We learned a lot about <em>how</em> to build great software in this time, so I’ll talk about that at the end.</p>\n<p>In part two (spoiler alert) I’ll talk about the changes we made to our technology stack and our design and front-end development teams.</p>\n<h2>Spring/Summer 2015</h2>\n<p>Back in April 2015 we knew <em>roughly</em> what teachers, students and parents wanted from the next version of Firefly. However, there was still lots of work to do to refine our ideas into a definite, focused list of features that would work for everyone.</p>\n<p>As Head of Product, Viv ran a number of discovery workshops with teachers, students and parents from a large number of our schools. Armed with this research, our UX team was able to start sketching solutions from which we could create interactive product mock-ups. These were then tested with more users, refined, and tested again.</p>\n<p>(figure set:testing)</p>\n<p>We didn’t just limit this discovery phase to the start of the project, we continued to conduct user research at every stage. We’re lucky that our clients don’t mind acting as guinea pigs and let us test all our crazy new ideas on them. We also engaged an agency to connect with non-client teachers, students and parents, to ensure that the new features would work for everyone, not just those used to Firefly already.</p>\n<h2>Autumn/Winter 2015</h2>\n<p>While research and design were progressing nicely, thoughts turned to a busy conference season. With the Firefly Learning Conference just around the corner and Bett looming, we knew we needed something more tangible than interactive mock-ups to show people.</p>\n<p>Bett, in particular, would be the first time clients and prospects alike could get hands-on with the new Firefly. We had to build a demo version of Firefly that would work well enough to give prospective clients a taste of what was to come in Firefly 6, that would also be robust enough to work with the WiFi in the ExCel centre.</p>\n<p>In a sterling effort by all involved, we cut a demo-ready version of Firefly less than 24 hours before the start of the show. Despite there being a few bits of hidden sticky-tape and string holding everything together, we had an amazingly successful Bett. The demo stood up to anyting our stand visitors threw at it, and I think its fair to say that everyone was suitably wowed.</p>\n<h2>Spring/Summer 2016</h2>\n<p>At the Firefly Learning Conference in November we’d confidently told our clients that they could expect Firefly 6 in the summer term. By the spring it was apparent that we couldn’t meet this deadline and release a version of Firefly that was of sufficient quality. So we took the difficult decision to delay the release to the next logical point where schools would have a chance to install it in-between terms: Christmas.</p>\n<p>In the summer we we’re able to release the new navigation, and because it was now in the hands of schools quickly iterate it based on feedback from a large group of users. As with all changes, it was met with a mixed reception, but the vast majority of users loved the changes we’d made.</p>\n<h2>Autumn/Winter 2016</h2>\n<p>We were now nearing the end of our development phase. A significant portion of both the web app and native iOS and Android apps had now been completed. We were on target for our completion date of 28th November, which would give us 2 weeks to do final testing before launch on 12th December.</p>\n<p>Building software is hard; Building great software is very hard. So it was understandable that the final few weeks before our production deadline was filled with late nights and many take-outs in the office.</p>\n<p>It is a testament to the diligent work of everyone involved that we brought this incredible new version in on time. Not just the team who built the software, but also the support, client experience, sales and marketing teams. They’re all responsible in equal part for Firefly 6.</p>\n<p>(figure set:team,class:span-both)</p>\n<h2>Please release me, let me go</h2>\n<p>Even the most old school software companies release their software more often than every 18 months, so why did we take a year-and-a-half to release Firefly 6?</p>\n<p>Well, the reality is that we were releasing, every two weeks in fact. We shipped <strong>35</strong> versions from <code>5.2.1</code> in April 2015 to <code>6.0.1</code> on 12th December 2016. These releases included a large number of bug fixes, and lots of new features and tweaks to existing features.</p>\n<p>So why was 6 such a big release? Well, this was such a step change that there were several Epics that wouldn’t make sense in isolation. For example, the new <em>Set A Task</em> flow allows teachers to create rich tasks with far more flexibility than tasks they could create in Firefly 5. Releasing this without any ability for students to respond to these tasks, or teachers then to mark the response was simply unfeasible.</p>\n<h2>Things we learned and changes we made</h2>\n<p>We’ve certainly have learned a thing or two along the way, not least that we need more development resource, but having just landing the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/15/firefly-takes-5-6m-series-a-for-its-learning-support-platform-for-schools/\">largest Series A investment</a> in Education Technology in the UK, we’re certainly now in a position to do that.</p>\n<p>It wouldn’t have been possible to build such complex software with a relatively small team without some smart ways of working. Over the last year-and-a-half we’ve made some big changes to the way we work, these help us work faster and release less bugs.</p>\n<h3>We established Epics, Squads and Guilds</h3>\n<p>We spilt sets of features up into logic chunks. These, we call <strong>Epics</strong>. An Epic is a set of features that makes sense end-to-end. For example, the new task setting flow was a single Epic. This included all the backend logic, and user interface elements for teachers, parents and students.</p>\n<p>Each Epic is owned by team called a <strong>Squad</strong>. A Squad is a self contained unit of UX’ers, Designers, Developers and a manager. Everyone who’s needed to research, design, build, refine and manage workflow for that one Epic.</p>\n<p>There are parts of the product that are relevant to more than one Squad. For example, the Pattern Library is used by all squads working on the Firefly web interface. To manage changes and updates to these areas we have <strong>Guilds</strong>. Typically a Guild will contain a representative from each Squad, and meet on an ad-hoc basis when changes are needed.</p>\n<h3>We moved</h3>\n<p>It would be remiss of me not to mention our new office. In October we moved from Lyric Square to the Aircraft Factory, in Hammersmith. We now have an amazing space that feels far more attuned to building brilliant software. We even have Joe’s old Raleigh Firefly bike (the inspiration for the name) in pride of place above his desk.</p>\n<p>(figure set:office)</p>\n<h3>We established the Nine Rules</h3>\n<p>I think what we’ve learned can be distilled into a set of principles that we’ve refined throughout this project. These are <strong>Firefly’s Nine Rules:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Frequent tasks should be easy and occasional tasks achievable</strong>. Teachers are incredibly busy, don’t give them a vast array of options.</li>\n<li><strong>Use smart defaults.</strong> We make good choices, so users don’t have to.</li>\n<li><strong>Don’t make me think.</strong> Make the next action obvious and unambiguous. Reduce unnecessary choices.</li>\n<li><strong>Beautiful by default.</strong> Teachers want to be proud of the things they create, so make this easy for them,</li>\n<li><strong>Optimise.</strong> Firefly should be fast.</li>\n<li><strong>Do less.</strong> Firefly should do a core set of things extremely well.</li>\n<li><strong>Design for teaching, not content management.</strong> Firefly isn’t a content management system, its a learning tool.</li>\n<li><strong>Right feature at the right moment.</strong> Too many options are confusing, be smart about when we expose a new feature.</li>\n<li><strong>Firefly isn’t just used in school</strong> Users should be able to achieve their task, no matter their location.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Where next?</h3>\n<p>Its an exciting time for Firefly. We’re expanding our team, and we’re brimming with ideas for the future. We’re working closely with a wide array of our clients to shape the next iteration of Firefly. There won’t be a large release for a while, but that’s exciting in itself, it means we’re going to work on smaller features that we can get into your hands quicker. I, for one, can’t wait to see what the next eighteen months brings.</p>\n"},{"title":"Common threads from Leading Design Conference 2016","date":"2016-10-26T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["design","conferences"],"filename":"56","content":"<p>I’ve just spent three days at the Barbican enjoying the inaugural Leading Design Conference. Having being promoted the role of Head of Design fairly recently, I found the vast majority of the talks and both workshops extremely poignant.</p>\n<p>This was also the sense I got from my fellow attendees. Chatting with people over lunch, or a beer later on, I was struck by just how many “Yeah, me too!” moments we had. It turns out that leading design is hard, but I’m reassured to know that people have the same problems as me.</p>\n<p>I was further reassured at the common themes that emerged over the event. It means we’re all on similar pages (or, at least we’re all reading the same book), and in an attempt to sift through those bits of knowledge that really spoke to me, here’s my top (sometimes badly paraphrased) common threads from the last three days. This is far-from all the messages that spoke to me, but this is the stuff that will have most immediate impact on my work:</p>\n<h2>Designing design</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://scottberkun.com/\">Scott Berkun</a>’s talk <em>Design vs. The World</em> started the conference on the right note with a big picture view of what it means to do design in the real world, and how it isn’t just pushing pixels around a screen. It got me thinking about my role, and how its increasingly solving problems that aren’t related to UI design, or writing CSS.</p>\n<p>Later, during the Q&amp;A session with <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/aboutthebbc/insidethebbc/managementstructure/biographies/whitney_julia/\">Julia Whitney</a> (BBC), <a href=\"http://www.dannyhearn.me/\">Danny Hearn</a> and <a href=\"https://www.markboulton.co.uk/\">Mark Boulton</a> (Monotype), it was said (with perhaps a hint of lamentation) that we’re no longer doing design at the coal-face, rather it’s our job to design the design experience: The environments and culture in which our teams works, and the processes they lean-on to get their work done.</p>\n<p>This really struck a chord with me.</p>\n<h2>Resistance is futile</h2>\n<p>Someone (I’m sorry I can’t remember who) included a slide of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borg_(Star_Trek)\">Locutus of Borg</a>, simultaneously making the point about assimilating into other team’s cultures, and scoring points with me for a Star Trek reference.</p>\n<p>In her talk <em>New on the Job: Your First 90 Days in a Design Leadership Role</em> <a href=\"http://pnts.us/\">Andrea Mignolo</a> talked about the “layer cake”, a delicious way to visualise the hierarchy in your company. She argued that you had to design the experience for each layer, to talk about design in the language of your audience.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/@ccourage\">Catherine Courage</a> said “Strive for shared empathy”, the points in the middle where you can meet and talk design in a way thats understandable by even the most numbers-driven business development manager.</p>\n<p>In both her talk and brilliant workshop <a href=\"http://www.practicallyux.com/\">Gail Swanson</a> taught us about presenting to decision makers. We used mapping techniques to better understand the drivers for those people from whom we seek approval. This is definitely a technique I’ll try at Firefly, to be able to frame an argument in a way that already fits in with the pressures and  priorities of others is incredibly powerful.</p>\n<h2>Dark matter</h2>\n<p>How do we quantify the value of design? Its difficult to ask quantitative questions when you’re dealing with solving problems on an emotional level. How would you measure a target like “Users feel 9% more engaged this quarter”? We don’t have the tools to measure qualitative data like this. And yet, this is the stuff that really adds value.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://nathan.com/\">Nathan Shedroff</a>’s talk <em>Using the Waveline: Mapping Premium Value to the User Journey (a new tool for planning deeper customer experiences)</em> detailed how to start to measure the emotional impact over time that your product or service has, and how this can be designed for maximum empathy.</p>\n<p>If you’re at all involved in designing anything for anyone (I would argue that’s everyone), then I’d recommend further reading into Nathan’s Waveline theories. It’s certainly something I’ll investigate further.</p>\n<h2>A quick note on the conference itself</h2>\n<p>Leading Design was perhaps the most useful, insightful and timely conference I’ve ever attended. Huge thanks to <a href=\"http://clearleft.com/is/andy-budd\">Andy Budd</a> et al for doing such a great job, and spotting the need for this event. You asked if we wanted another in 2017, its a resounding “yes” from me.</p>\n<p>The last thing I want to mention was the venue. I jumped a the chance for a tour of the Barbican during the lunch break the second day. If you’re a fan of brutalist architecture then this site is must-see. It was the perfect venue for a fantastic three days of conference.</p>\n"}]},{"name":"design leadership","count":1,"items":[{"title":"Some thoughts on design leadership","tags":["leading design conference","design","design leadership","barbican","conferences"],"date":"2017-10-30T00:00:00.000Z","filename":"67","content":"<p>I spent some of last week listening to some great design leaders share their thoughts at <a href=\"https://2017.leadingdesignconf.com/\">Leading Design 2017</a>.

We used mapping techniques to better understand the drivers for those people from whom we seek approval. This is definitely a technique I’ll try at Firefly, to be able to frame an argument in a way that already fits in with the pressures and  priorities of others is incredibly powerful.</p>\n<h2>Dark matter</h2>\n<p>How do we quantify the value of design? Its difficult to ask quantitative questions when you’re dealing with solving problems on an emotional level. How would you measure a target like “Users feel 9% more engaged this quarter”? We don’t have the tools to measure qualitative data like this. And yet, this is the stuff that really adds value.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://nathan.com/\">Nathan Shedroff</a>’s talk <em>Using the Waveline: Mapping Premium Value to the User Journey (a new tool for planning deeper customer experiences)</em> detailed how to start to measure the emotional impact over time that your product or service has, and how this can be designed for maximum empathy.</p>\n<p>If you’re at all involved in designing anything for anyone (I would argue that’s everyone), then I’d recommend further reading into Nathan’s Waveline theories. It’s certainly something I’ll investigate further.</p>\n<h2>A quick note on the conference itself</h2>\n<p>Leading Design was perhaps the most useful, insightful and timely conference I’ve ever attended. Huge thanks to <a href=\"http://clearleft.com/is/andy-budd\">Andy Budd</a> et al for doing such a great job, and spotting the need for this event. You asked if we wanted another in 2017, its a resounding “yes” from me.</p>\n<p>The last thing I want to mention was the venue. I jumped a the chance for a tour of the Barbican during the lunch break the second day. If you’re a fan of brutalist architecture then this site is must-see. It was the perfect venue for a fantastic three days of conference.</p>\n"},{"date":"2015-11-12T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Firefly Learning Conference 2015","images":[{"image":"conference-2015-cover.jpg","caption":"Simon, at the Firefly Learning Conference 2015"},{"image":"conference-2015-josh-01.jpg","caption":"Some of Josh’s cartoons generating quite a lot of interest","set":"josh","width":3289,"height":2642},{"image":"conference-2015-josh-02.jpg","caption":"Badger, badger, badger (mushroom, mushroom)","set":"josh","width":3184,"height":2388},{"image":"conference-2015-team-01.jpg","caption":"Teachers receive a warm welcome from Team Firefly","set":"team"},{"image":"conference-2015-team-02.jpg","caption":"Abi and David","set":"team"},{"image":"conference-2015-team-03.jpg","caption":"Fireflies queue for lunch","set":"team"}],"tags":["conferences","firefly"],"filename":"54","content":"<p>Aside from <a href=\"http://www.bettshow.com/\">The Bett Show</a>, the Firefly Learning Conference is our biggest UK event of the year.

We’ve really built on that move this year; With an expanded product team and a huge push to make user experience a core part of how we build software. My team, Design, have been instrumental in the development of Firefly 6. We now sit as part of the product team, and along side Development and UX we’ve undertaken the design of four new iOS apps and the design and front-end build of Firefly on the web.</p>\n<p>Over the last few months we’ve updated almost all our processes, right from the way we’ve massively increased the amount of research we do with teachers, students and parents; to creating a pattern library for all our front-end code.</p>\n<p>I’ve <a href=\"/articles/46/\">said it before</a>, but it bares repeating: I’m incredibly proud of all we’ve achieved this year, and can’t wait to get Firefly 6 into the hands of our teachers and their students.</p>\n"},{"date":"2014-11-13T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Firefly Conference 2014","section":"articles","tags":["firefly","conferences"],"cover":"/assets/blog/covers/0104 Firefly.jpg","images":[{"image":"Firefly.jpg","caption":"The partners Joe & Simon and (some of) the design team at the Firefly Learning Conference 2014","set":"team"}],"filename":"46","content":"<p>Over the last couple of months Firefly’s design team have been even busier than usual.

Designers have long had the idea of designing interfaces from a kit of pre-built parts, but never really had the tools to do this effectively. Sketch is such a tool.</p>\n<p>At Firefly, we’ve recently made the transition to Sketch specifically because of the power of symbols. These have enabled us to build our pattern library in a way that helps us to do some extremely rapid prototyping and create consistent experiences for our users.</p>\n<p>Our Front-End and iOS teams already have their own pattern libraries. These are different, partly due to technical reasons, but there’s another reason we kept the patterns separate. As we continue to strive for feature parity between platforms, its obvious that there are some fundamental differences between web and iOS.  There is a <em>way</em> of doing things in iOS — interactions that users expect — that’s different from the web. Hence, web and iOS have the same features, but implemented in the way that makes the most sense to users of that platform.</p>\n<p>Our dream was to create two design pattern libraries that would contain the same elements as the web and iOS libraries. This would mean that we’d all be working from the same list of patterns, rather than adding a translation step when it came to implementation.</p>\n<h2>Structure</h2>\n<p>We studied the structure of the existing pattern libraries and created a map that included all patterns, their modifiers and states. This gave us the structure for our patterns, and a place to start from when translating programatic patterns into something that would be useable in Sketch.</p>\n<p>In simple terms, our pattern library is a number of Sketch files containing — as symbols — all the elements in the Firefly interface. We divide these into separate files, one for each platform. We’ve also broken web into web-core and one file for each of our <a href=\"http://themes.fireflylearning.com\">four core themes</a>.</p>\n<p>In each of the files, we’ve categorised our symbols into areas. This helps massively with your mental model when browsing the symbols page. This also allows us to print a visual style-guide of all our patterns.</p>\n<p>(figure set:categorising,class:poke-both)</p>\n<h2>Symbols</h2>\n<p>Sketch supports symbol nesting and overrides. This makes symbols extremely powerful. This allows you to create a pattern element by combining symbols together.</p>\n<p>However, organisation is everything. If you don’t follow a systematic approach to creating patterns, they’re extremely difficult to use in the wild. We know from experience that confusion arises about which symbols are patterns, and which are simply the building blocks of patterns. Let me explain…</p>\n<h3>Parts and Patterns</h3>\n<p>(figure set:button-anatomy,class:pull-right)</p>\n<p>A pattern is made up of either parts or other symbols. Each part is a symbol. A Button, for example, is made up of two parts <em>Background</em> and <em>Label</em>, and another pattern <em>Icon</em>. We use <a href=\"https://www.sketchapp.com/learn/documentation/symbols/organizing-symbols/\">slash notation</a> to organise parts and patterns under one namespace.</p>\n<p>(figure set:dropdown,class:poke-both)</p>\n<p>Organising our symbols this way makes it easy when using a pattern. It’s immediately obvious from the list of symbols which is a pattern that’s intended for use, and which are just the building blocks of patterns.</p>\n<h3>Using Patterns in the wild</h3>\n<p>When designing a new feature, we’ll start out with a blank sketch file. Let’s say, for example, that we wanted a very simple interface that required two buttons: OK and Cancel. OK needs to be a cancel type with a tick icon, and Cancel needs to be a default type with a cross icon.</p>\n<p>In our pattern library file, we have a page called <em>scratch</em> where we can set up a pattern ready to be copied into another file. We select the <code>Button &gt; Patterns &gt; Button with Icon Left</code> symbol from the list and drop it into our scratch page. We can then use the symbol overrides to change it’s Background, Icon and Label as required. We can also override the text.</p>\n<p>(figure set:using-a-symbol,class:poke-both)</p>\n<p>Once the pattern is set up, we can then copy this into the new document. This only copies the parts required for this instance of the pattern. So trying to change the symbol overrides in the new file won’t work until you copy over all variations of a pattern.</p>\n<h2>Tips ’n tricks</h2>\n<p>There’s a few areas where symbols are ripe for improvement. Given Bohemian’s track record for updates and bug fixes I suspect these can’t be too far off. Meantime, there’s a couple of workarounds that we’ve found particularly useful that I’d like to share.</p>\n<h3>Pin to corner</h3>\n<p>The ability to change resize behaviour in symbols is extremely useful. However, the “Pin to corner” option is somewhat limited as it doesn’t let you specify <em>which</em> corner.</p>\n<p>(figure set:pintocorner,class:pull-right)</p>\n<p>We solve this by simply grouping a transparent shape in with the layer we wish to align. This allows you pin to other corners than the one that Sketch might have automatically picked for you.</p>\n<h3>Override colours of icons</h3>\n<p>It’s annoying to have to have separate symbols for different icon colours. Especially when adding a new colour, meaning you have to create a new symbol for all the icons in the new colour.</p>\n<p>Luckily, we can use layer masks and overrides to easily add colour options. An Icon pattern is actually a grouped rectangle masked out by the icon shape. We are then able to control the icon type <em>and</em> colour from a pre-defined pallet of colours. Adding a new colour is as easy as adding a new icon mask symbol.</p>\n<p>(figure set:overridecolour,class:poke-both)</p>\n<p>Another small tip: Make your icons and masks different sizes, that way you won’t get shown all the icons and colours together in the overrides dropdown.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Sharing patterns</h2>\n<p>So far I’ve not really touched on how we’re using our pattern library across a team. An essential part of any pattern library is its use beyond a single person. When we set out to create our pattern library, we had a simple set of requirements:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Symbols should be stored in a central location that is accessible by the whole team</li>\n<li>Symbols can be linked across files, updating a symbol in any file updates it everywhere</li>\n<li>Editing clashes are handled in a nice way</li>\n<li>Symbols can be organised into categories</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>What we’re currently doing</h3>\n<p>Initially we experimented with <a href=\"https://www.invisionapp.com/craft\">Craft</a> from inVision. It’s library functionality would allow us to store symbols in a central location, share them across the team. Most excitingly of all, symbols would be linked across files, meaning we could ensure we were always using the latest version in our designs.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, when it came to handling editing clashes, Craft did less well. We lost an entire week of work due to our library file becoming corrupted. We were told that this was a known issue, and the file was unrecoverable. We decided not to entrust our entire pattern library to Craft, there was no way we could risk that happening again.</p>\n<p>We switched to using Sketch files themselves to contain our patterns. A downside to this solution was that editing clashes weren’t handled, at all. Rather, whoever saved the file last would overwrite work of anyone else. Thankfully, <a href=\"https://abstractapp.com/\">Abstract</a> came to our rescue.</p>\n<p>The team has been using Abstract for version management of Sketch files for the last few weeks, and what a difference it’s made! Once you have the git mental model in your head, Abstract’s workflow makes a lot of sense. We can now branch off the master pattern library document, make our changes, and merge back. Clashes are handled visually, giving you the choice of which symbol definition to keep.</p>\n<p>(figure set:abstarct,class:poke-both)</p>\n<p>We now have three out of four of our original requirements. We’re almost there! But what about linking symbols across files?</p>\n<h2>A native solution?</h2>\n<p>I’d argue that level of complexity represented by shared symbols in Sketch requires a native solution. Plugins, like Craft, will only ever be a poly-fill at best.</p>\n<p>Looking at the features that Bohemian have added to Sketch over the last few versions, I strongly suspect that they’re already planning shared symbols. It’s a natural fit for them, they already have the cloud infrastructure from Sketch Cloud and with their new open JSON formatted files, it seems like this might be the next logical step.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Are you looking for a new design challenge in London?

If you don’t follow a systematic approach to creating patterns, they’re extremely difficult to use in the wild. We know from experience that confusion arises about which symbols are patterns, and which are simply the building blocks of patterns. Let me explain…</p>\n<h3>Parts and Patterns</h3>\n<p>(figure set:button-anatomy,class:pull-right)</p>\n<p>A pattern is made up of either parts or other symbols. Each part is a symbol. A Button, for example, is made up of two parts <em>Background</em> and <em>Label</em>, and another pattern <em>Icon</em>. We use <a href=\"https://www.sketchapp.com/learn/documentation/symbols/organizing-symbols/\">slash notation</a> to organise parts and patterns under one namespace.</p>\n<p>(figure set:dropdown,class:poke-both)</p>\n<p>Organising our symbols this way makes it easy when using a pattern. It’s immediately obvious from the list of symbols which is a pattern that’s intended for use, and which are just the building blocks of patterns.</p>\n<h3>Using Patterns in the wild</h3>\n<p>When designing a new feature, we’ll start out with a blank sketch file. Let’s say, for example, that we wanted a very simple interface that required two buttons: OK and Cancel. OK needs to be a cancel type with a tick icon, and Cancel needs to be a default type with a cross icon.</p>\n<p>In our pattern library file, we have a page called <em>scratch</em> where we can set up a pattern ready to be copied into another file. We select the <code>Button &gt; Patterns &gt; Button with Icon Left</code> symbol from the list and drop it into our scratch page. We can then use the symbol overrides to change it’s Background, Icon and Label as required. We can also override the text.</p>\n<p>(figure set:using-a-symbol,class:poke-both)</p>\n<p>Once the pattern is set up, we can then copy this into the new document. This only copies the parts required for this instance of the pattern. So trying to change the symbol overrides in the new file won’t work until you copy over all variations of a pattern.</p>\n<h2>Tips ’n tricks</h2>\n<p>There’s a few areas where symbols are ripe for improvement. Given Bohemian’s track record for updates and bug fixes I suspect these can’t be too far off. Meantime, there’s a couple of workarounds that we’ve found particularly useful that I’d like to share.</p>\n<h3>Pin to corner</h3>\n<p>The ability to change resize behaviour in symbols is extremely useful. However, the “Pin to corner” option is somewhat limited as it doesn’t let you specify <em>which</em> corner.</p>\n<p>(figure set:pintocorner,class:pull-right)</p>\n<p>We solve this by simply grouping a transparent shape in with the layer we wish to align. This allows you pin to other corners than the one that Sketch might have automatically picked for you.</p>\n<h3>Override colours of icons</h3>\n<p>It’s annoying to have to have separate symbols for different icon colours. Especially when adding a new colour, meaning you have to create a new symbol for all the icons in the new colour.</p>\n<p>Luckily, we can use layer masks and overrides to easily add colour options. An Icon pattern is actually a grouped rectangle masked out by the icon shape. We are then able to control the icon type <em>and</em> colour from a pre-defined pallet of colours. Adding a new colour is as easy as adding a new icon mask symbol.</p>\n<p>(figure set:overridecolour,class:poke-both)</p>\n<p>Another small tip: Make your icons and masks different sizes, that way you won’t get shown all the icons and colours together in the overrides dropdown.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Sharing patterns</h2>\n<p>So far I’ve not really touched on how we’re using our pattern library across a team. An essential part of any pattern library is its use beyond a single person. When we set out to create our pattern library, we had a simple set of requirements:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Symbols should be stored in a central location that is accessible by the whole team</li>\n<li>Symbols can be linked across files, updating a symbol in any file updates it everywhere</li>\n<li>Editing clashes are handled in a nice way</li>\n<li>Symbols can be organised into categories</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>What we’re currently doing</h3>\n<p>Initially we experimented with <a href=\"https://www.invisionapp.com/craft\">Craft</a> from inVision. It’s library functionality would allow us to store symbols in a central location, share them across the team. Most excitingly of all, symbols would be linked across files, meaning we could ensure we were always using the latest version in our designs.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, when it came to handling editing clashes, Craft did less well. We lost an entire week of work due to our library file becoming corrupted. We were told that this was a known issue, and the file was unrecoverable. We decided not to entrust our entire pattern library to Craft, there was no way we could risk that happening again.</p>\n<p>We switched to using Sketch files themselves to contain our patterns. A downside to this solution was that editing clashes weren’t handled, at all. Rather, whoever saved the file last would overwrite work of anyone else. Thankfully, <a href=\"https://abstractapp.com/\">Abstract</a> came to our rescue.</p>\n<p>The team has been using Abstract for version management of Sketch files for the last few weeks, and what a difference it’s made! Once you have the git mental model in your head, Abstract’s workflow makes a lot of sense. We can now branch off the master pattern library document, make our changes, and merge back. Clashes are handled visually, giving you the choice of which symbol definition to keep.</p>\n<p>(figure set:abstarct,class:poke-both)</p>\n<p>We now have three out of four of our original requirements. We’re almost there! But what about linking symbols across files?</p>\n<h2>A native solution?</h2>\n<p>I’d argue that level of complexity represented by shared symbols in Sketch requires a native solution. Plugins, like Craft, will only ever be a poly-fill at best.</p>\n<p>Looking at the features that Bohemian have added to Sketch over the last few versions, I strongly suspect that they’re already planning shared symbols. It’s a natural fit for them, they already have the cloud infrastructure from Sketch Cloud and with their new open JSON formatted files, it seems like this might be the next logical step.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Are you looking for a new design challenge in London?

The reason for this flurry of activity was three new themes we’d be working for the big launch at the Firefly Learning Conference.</p>\n<p>There’s a <a href=\"http://fireflylearning.com/blog/firefly-learning-conference-round-up\">full writeup</a> on the Firefly blog, but I wanted to share a little about the process of creating the new themes that we hope will give students, teachers and parents an improved experience while using Firefly.</p>\n<p>Since the launch of Firefly 5 last year, we’ve learnt a lot from our clients about what worked for them and what didn’t.  We’ve also worked with some fantastic schools, creating bespoke themes, which gave us a wealth of ideas of the features students and teachers really want.</p>\n<p>Using this feedback, we were able to distill a clear list of the <em>type</em> of themes schools wanted, along with the customisation options that would appeal. We determined to build three new themes: One a playful, friendly theme; Another, clean and succinct; Lastly, a super minimalist theme.</p>\n<p>When I joined, just over three years ago, Firefly were five people crammed into a small office hidden away in a dark corner of One Lyric Square. The design department consisted of me and a pack of half empty Sharpies. Today we’re a forty strong team, with three (soon to be four) designers, with our own office in sunny Brighton. Over the summer holidays we were joined by intern <a href=\"http://www.adammmarsh.com\">Adam Marsh</a> and, with his help, we set about designing the new themes.</p>\n<p>(figure set:team)</p>\n<p>I’m really proud of the hard work the entire team put in creating the new themes. This is just the start, we’re planning a number of upgrades to these themes as well as several new themes in the coming months.</p>\n<p>You can see all the Firefly themes at <a href=\"http://themes.fireflylearning.com\">themes.fireflylearning.com</a>.</p>\n"}]},{"name":"italy","count":3,"items":[{"title":"Tuscany with a toddler","date":"2017-04-18T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["travel","italy","toddlers"],"images":[{"image":"roo-alps.jpg","caption":"Roo, captivated by the view of the Alps from 38,000 ft","set":"alps"},{"image":"alps.jpg","caption":"The view of the Alps","set":"alps"},{"image":"house.jpg","caption":"Our villa for the week in San Lorenzo a Vaccoli, Lucca","set":"house"},{"image":"bike-in-lucca.jpg","caption":"Katie and Roo cycling on the walls of Lucca.","set":"bike"},{"image":"lunch-in-lucca.jpg","caption":"Enjoying some Pizza at Ristorante San Colombano, Lucca","set":"lunch"},{"image":"lucca-skyline.jpg","caption":"The view from the top of the Torre Delle Ore, Lucca","set":"tower"},{"image":"merry-go-round.jpg","caption":"Katie and Roo enjoying the Merry-go-round, goodness knows who she’s waving at","set":"merrygoround"},{"image":"leaning-tower.jpg","caption":"Of course we had to take this shot of the Leaning Tower","set":"leaningtower"},{"image":"gardens-pisa.jpg","caption":"Grandma and Roo enjoying the shade in the Botanical Gardens in Pisa","set":"gardens"},{"image":"last-day.jpg","caption":"Katie, my dad and mum in the grounds of our villa on the last day","set":"lastday"}],"filename":"63","content":"<p>As a surprise for my mum’s 70th, my dad invited us on a pre Easter break to a house he’d rented in San Lorenzo a Vaccoli, a sleepy village a few kilometres outside of Lucca, in Italy’s Tuscany region.</p>\n<p>The ratio of 4 adults to one toddler certainly made things a little easier with <em>Roo</em>.

Headphones in, I’m listening to Fink’s “Sort of Revolution” extremely loud and enjoying an ice-cold beer. I lean my head back, and close my eyes against the sun as it dapples through the leaves above me. In the distance are the mountains that circle Lake Garda. Sparse clouds are suspended, seemingly motionless over the azure blue waters. Fuelled by the warmth of the sun, the melodic beat of the music and the haze from the alcohol I feel an almost zen-like sense of well-being. “This is perfect” I thought.</p>\n<p>In contrast to week one, when we’d travelled through five countries, we decided to slow the pace a little. After an epic drive our first stop was the Northern lake town of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nago–Torbole\">Torbole</a>, the windsurfers paradise, and <a href=\"http://www.campingalporto.it/camp/\">Camping Al Porto</a>. It felt Newquay-esq where board-shorts seemed to be the must-have fashion item of the season. The campsite was rather busier than those we’d been used to, but we managed to fit our van and awning on a shaded pitch thirty-seconds walk from the lake.</p>\n<p>(figure set:torbole)</p>\n<p>On the occasion of our first night in Italy, we did what we have the last two trips here: Find the most touristy looking restaurant and order the biggest pizza they have and a glass of the local beer. In this case it was <a href=\"http://www.forst.it/eng\">Forst</a>, brewed “just up the road” we were told.</p>\n<p>The next day we had ideas of taking windsurfing lesson but the wind didn’t seem to want to blow. It was probably too hot, so like us it decided to spend the day sunbathing and exploring the town. We also finally got the BBQ to work despite the crappy “just light the bag” charcoal, thanks to some German firelighters that almost took my face off.</p>\n<p>It was at this point we cheated a little by spending a few nights in a hotel south of the lake in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desenzano_del_Garda\">Desenzano del Garda</a>. “You know” said Katie “I’m loving being able to get out of the shower and being able to keep my feet dry.” I knew what she meant. I’m not proud to admit it but we really did wallow in the luxurious of it all.</p>\n<p>(gallery set:hotel)</p>\n<p>Peeling ourselves away from the hotel pool we ventured down the road to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirmione\">Sirmione</a>. Navigating the spit of land that forms a sort of natural pier into the centre of the southern bank of the lake — we parked and ventured over the bridge into down-town Sirmione. Here we indulged our inner tourist once again by eating gelato and watching the sunset.</p>\n<p>(figure set:sirmione)</p>\n<p>Having made a large dent in our holiday funds we checked out of the hotel and moved north around the lake to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazise\">Lazise</a>. Here we encountered the full glory of the Italian campsite. When you’re a good few kilometres from the centre on the main road you start to notice the signs. At first a just few, then more with increasing ferocity until they line the bank of the lake one after the other. You’re not, as we discovered, just expected to pick one and check-in. We spent an interesting couple of hours driving from site to site inspecting toilet blocks, pools, children’s entertainment and on-site bars before we finally gave in and just picked one.</p>\n<p>(figure set:lazisesite)</p>\n<p>Here we stayed and for four glorious days enjoyed the private beach and exploring the beautiful town. We swam, snorkelled and sunbathed. Ate gelato, pizza and even brought a fridge-magnet. No messing about, this was a proper holiday.</p>\n<p>Alas, it was time to move on. Switzerland and our final week beaconed. We have a week left and just over two-thousand kilometres back to the Euro-tunnel at Calais.</p>\n<p>To be continued…</p>\n"},{"date":"2007-10-16T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Lake Garda, Italy","images":[{"image":"1586607502_2ae186c936_o.jpg","set":"lake","caption":"Me and her by the lake"},{"image":"1586170404_39ede07bdb_o.jpg","set":"lake2","caption":"Sirmione"},{"image":"1585611537_e540e1204f_o.jpg","set":"gondola","caption":"Gondola"}],"tags":["travel","italy"],"filename":"27","content":"<p>The weather was warm, the food was amazing and the wine was cheep. After 7 nights in Italy drifting around Lake Garda, being awed (and a little romantic) in Verona and getting (very) lost in Venice the reality of being back to work has hit like a tonne of bricks.</p>\n<p>(figure set:lake)</p>\n<p>But I prefer to think of the amazing time we had. As we landed at the tiny Besica airport we realised that the turbulence we had just endured was in fact heavy rain that drenched us as we ran from the plane to the cover of the arrivals lounge. From there we found ourselves sitting in the hire car, rain pounding on the windscreen, trying to get used to the uneasy feeling of sitting in the passenger side with a steering wheel in front of me. By the time we reached <a href=\"http://www.mistralhotels.it/admiral.htm\">our hotel</a> we’d driven on three motorways and had a tiny disagreement with a barrier.</p>\n<p>Thankfully the wing-mirror was unharmed and the rain had stopped to reveal blue sky. Things got even better when we got into our room - it was clean, big and had a balcony from which you could see the lake (sort of) through the trees. We spent the week exploring Lake Garda’s small towns and excellent restaurants, and venturing out to Verona and eventually Venice after planning to go on Wednesday and finally getting there on Friday - Due to a couple of days missing the train. Whoops!</p>\n<p>(figure set:lake2)</p>\n<p>My favourite place by far was Sirmione which was at the end of an tiny outcrop of land that juts into the south end of the lake. We spent an evening at the naturally heated <a href=\"http://www.termedisirmione.it/tds/en/homepage.html\">spa</a> followed by dinner at <a href=\"http://www.ristorantearcimboldo.com/\">L’Archimboldo</a> run by a really friendly guy who’s English was better than ours. If you’re going to Lake Garda Sirmione is a must.</p>\n<p>(figure set:gondola)</p>\n<p>Venice was amazing. Stepping out of the station, you’re immediately greeted with throngs of people walking up and down the banks of the Grand Canal. Wow! We took a water taxi up to St. Marks Square and stopped for lunch and some shelter from the hot-hot sun before we ventured into St Mark’s Basilica and mooched around the Square, avoiding the millions of pigeons that randomly landed on anyone they fancied, whether they had food or not.</p>\n<p>We then set off around the labyrinth-like city on foot, exploring the seemingly unending passageways and tiny bridges. Needless to say we got horribly lost, and only just made our train back to the hotel. But I loved Venice, a day was just not enough. In usual style, I took nearly 700 photos - and you can <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/roobottom/sets/72157602449502521/\">see some of them over at flickr</a>.</p>\n<p>Oh well, back to reality I suppose.</p>\n"}]},{"name":"toddlers","count":2,"items":[{"title":"Tuscany with a toddler","date":"2017-04-18T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["travel","italy","toddlers"],"images":[{"image":"roo-alps.jpg","caption":"Roo, captivated by the view of the Alps from 38,000 ft","set":"alps"},{"image":"alps.jpg","caption":"The view of the Alps","set":"alps"},{"image":"house.jpg","caption":"Our villa for the week in San Lorenzo a Vaccoli, Lucca","set":"house"},{"image":"bike-in-lucca.jpg","caption":"Katie and Roo cycling on the walls of Lucca.","set":"bike"},{"image":"lunch-in-lucca.jpg","caption":"Enjoying some Pizza at Ristorante San Colombano, Lucca","set":"lunch"},{"image":"lucca-skyline.jpg","caption":"The view from the top of the Torre Delle Ore, Lucca","set":"tower"},{"image":"merry-go-round.jpg","caption":"Katie and Roo enjoying the Merry-go-round, goodness knows who she’s waving at","set":"merrygoround"},{"image":"leaning-tower.jpg","caption":"Of course we had to take this shot of the Leaning Tower","set":"leaningtower"},{"image":"gardens-pisa.jpg","caption":"Grandma and Roo enjoying the shade in the Botanical Gardens in Pisa","set":"gardens"},{"image":"last-day.jpg","caption":"Katie, my dad and mum in the grounds of our villa on the last day","set":"lastday"}],"filename":"63","content":"<p>As a surprise for my mum’s 70th, my dad invited us on a pre Easter break to a house he’d rented in San Lorenzo a Vaccoli, a sleepy village a few kilometres outside of Lucca, in Italy’s Tuscany region.</p>\n<p>The ratio of 4 adults to one toddler certainly made things a little easier with <em>Roo</em>.

It was great! It had a gated pool, and all the toys the child could ever want. It was also close to beaches, restaurants and interesting places to visit.</p>\n<p>The weather was a bit of a mixed bag, we had a few nice days, but if you like it hot (Like I do) then mid-October isn’t really the time to visit Portugal. It certainly wasn’t warm enough to heat the solar-powered pool heater. I went in a few times, but it was too cold for Katie and <em>Roo</em>.</p>\n<h2>Striking a balance</h2>\n<p>Every now and again I have a moment where it dawns on me that we have a child now, and our lives will never be the same again. Our first family holiday was one of those moments. Gone were the late night meals-out and morning lay-ins of holidays gone by. We could no longer plan days out that consisted purely of thing that Katie and I wanted to do. We had a little head to consider.</p>\n<h2>Things we liked</h2>\n<p>I think we managed to strike a balance, and found activities that we all enjoyed. <em>Roo</em> (for the most part) was happy to go with the flow, and enjoyed exploring new places.</p>\n<p>Here’s some of the things we liked in and around Caldas da Rainha.</p>\n<h3>Food</h3>\n<p>The Portuguese all seemed to love children, so made eating out at lunch extremely easy. There were excellent restaurants almost  everywhere we went, but a personal favourite was the vegetarian restaurant <a href=\"http://maratona.tv/\">Maratona</a> in the centre of Caldas. They were brilliant with <em>Roo</em>, rushing through an order of chips to prevent the inevitable mealtime meltdown.</p>\n<p>(figure set:maratona)</p>\n<h3>Exploring</h3>\n<p>We were delighted to find that <em>Roo</em> didn’t mind mooching around villages and towns. She was fascinated by the shops full of (mainly tile-based) gifts. As long as she was fed and could enjoy the occasional ice cream she was happy.</p>\n<p>The monastery at Albobaça was a particular favourite, with it’s large stone rooms. She loved hearing her footsteps and voice echoing down the corridors, <em>“echo, Mummy!”</em></p>\n<p>(figure set:monastery,class:span-both)</p>\n<p>We also really liked \u000fÓbidos, a fortified city that dates back to the 13th century. She loved the shops, castle and ice cream. We loved exploring the castle walls, the wonderful weather and the local cherry liqueur that you drink from a chocolate cup.</p>\n<h3>Lisbon Oceanarium</h3>\n<p>She <em>loved</em> the Oceanarium in Lisbon. We did have to queue a little for tickets (top tip: book online before you go) but the efficient staff meant our wait was fairly short.</p>\n<p>I would love to know what she was thinking as she stared up at the double-floor height tank full, packed to the <em>gills</em> with all kind of fish. Its difficult to know what goes through that little head, but she chatted about <em>“fsh”</em> all the way back to the Villa.</p>\n<p>(figure set:oceanarium)</p>\n<h3>Buddha Eden</h3>\n<p>The Buddha Eden in Bombarral is an amazing place. Set in 30 acres of beautiful gardens are hundreds of sculptures from all over Asia. <em>Roo</em> loved the wide open spaces and all the huge sculptures. There’s also some well times cafés where we were able to refuel while <em>Roo</em> had a sleep in her push-chair.</p>\n<p>(figure set:buddha)</p>\n<h3>Beaches, parks and gardens</h3>\n<p>Besides all the things we paid money for, there were plenty of free things that we enjoyed too. There is a beautiful park in Caldas that was a big hit with <em>Roo</em>, full of amazing green spaces, a lovely play-park and a couple of nice cafés.</p>\n<p>There’s also some really great beaches in this area, which were deserted when we visited, it being so late in the year. The sea was freezing, but that didn’t stop <em>Roo</em> enjoying a paddle.</p>\n<p>(figure set:park)</p>\n<h2>Things we didn’t like as much</h2>\n<p>The flight home was a bit rubbish. We’d stayed in a hotel at the airport the night before, but hadn’t really thought through the night sharing a room with <em>Roo</em>. So, between a disturbed night in a strange room and the 4:30am start to get our early flight its fair to say that <em>Roo</em> wasn’t in the best of moods.</p>\n<p>Halfway home, in order to placate our struggling child, Katie had taken her on a walk down the isle to visit the cabin crew. While there she decided to vomit over the side of the plane and several unsuspecting passengers. Tiredness had gotten the better of her.</p>\n<h2>In summary</h2>\n<p>We had a brilliant time in Portugal, we’d thoroughly recommend it as a holiday destination with a small child. It was different, for sure, but I think we made it work, and made some more happy memories with the <em>Roo</em>.</p>\n"}]},{"name":"music","count":2,"items":[{"title":"SOHN live at the Electric in Brixton","tags":["music"],"images":[{"image":"sohn-at-the-electric.jpg","caption":"SOHN, live at the Electric, 1st March 2017","set":"SOHN"}],"date":"2017-03-10T00:00:00.000Z","modifier":"dark","filename":"62","content":"<p>We’d been hankering to see <strong>SOHN</strong> for a while, ever since I’d played his first album, <em>Tremors</em>, almost to death last summer.

Everyone was swept along on the wave of <strong>SOHN</strong>’s synths, it put me in mind of a shared religious experience, everyone in enraptured ensemble.</p>\n<p>I was also massively impressed by the beautiful set design: An arrangement of parallel strip-lights that changed colour and pulsed on and off in step with the music.

Thrashing out ideas with paper and pen is a great way of capturing early ideas quickly with the minimum of fuss. Together with user research, sketching is among the first steps we take whenever we’re designing a new feature.</p>\n<p>We’re also constantly refining our processes, always on the lookout for more efficient ways to build better software that allow our users to perform the tasks they find most useful.</p>\n<p>We’ve recently started using some ideas from a methodology called <strong>Design Sprints</strong>. Although its still early days, I wanted to share our experience of (what I’m calling) Firefly-flavoured Design Sprints.</p>\n<p>(figure set:squad)</p>\n<h2>What is a design sprint?</h2>\n<p>The design sprint was developed by Jake Knapp from <a href=\"http://www.gv.com/sprint/\">Google Ventures</a>. In its full form, its a five day process for answering business questions through design. Its a way to fail early meaning you, <em>theoretically</em>, deliver something that works first time.</p>\n<p>Implicit in the process is the requirement to gather opinions from all areas of the business, not just the design team. Typically you might involve those with customer contact, for example the support or client-experience teams. You may also invite an expert from finance and marketing as well as members from the tech and design teams.</p>\n<p>A plan for the week might look like this:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr><th>Day</th><th>Outline</th></tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td>Monday</td><td>Understanding the challenge and decide what problem you’re trying to solve</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Tuesday</td><td>A number of different sketching activities to fully explore potential solutions</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Wednesday</td><td>The whole team presents and votes on solutions from Tuesday.</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Thursday</td><td>Creating a prototype of a chosen solution.</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Friday</td><td>Testing your prototype with real users and gathering feedback.</td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>What’s the benefit for Firefly?</h2>\n<p>We’ve been getting excited about Design Sprints for a while. The mantra of “fail early” is especially useful as it helps us to stay agile in a fast-paced market place.</p>\n<p>We’ve always listened closely to what teachers, students and parents want, but understanding exactly what they’ll find genuinely useful is rather more difficult.</p>\n<p>A process like Design Sprints helps us get our ideas in-front of customers at the earliest possible opportunity, and find out if what we <em>think</em> they want is actually useful, without going through the long process of design, build and QA first.</p>\n<h2>Our experience</h2>\n<p>We already had a very well defined problem, namely how to give schools greater flexibility in their Firefly navigation. In the sprint we’d set out to design both the updated navigation and the administration interface that would allow site administrators to customise the menu.</p>\n<p>I ran the day, as the “facilitator”. Viviana, our product manager, was the “decider”. The Communications squad (a cross-discipline team who would be building the feature) were our sketching team.</p>\n<p>We used a number of the activities from the Design Sprints book, together with a mix of activities from elsewhere that we thought would enable us to solve this problem in a day.</p>\n<h3>Jobs to be done</h3>\n<p>Before the sprint, Viv created a list of <strong>jobs to be done</strong>. Based directly from feedback, these are a way to think about tasks that users want to achieve. They’re written in a way so as the focus is on the task rather than a particular technology or solution, an example of this might be:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When organising the school’s Firefly pages, I want to be able to divide pages into highly visible sections, so I can make it easier to find content that is relevant for students, parents and teachers and show off the content we have.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Sketching</h3>\n<p>We went through a number of sketching exercises, first creating quick low fidelity sketches to flesh-out some early ideas. Then we moved on to creating more detailed sketches that detailed a whole user journey.</p>\n<p>(figure set:sketching)</p>\n<h3>Arriving at a solution</h3>\n<p>After each of the team had taken it in turns to present their sketch, we moved onto a round of <strong>heat mapping</strong>. Everyone was given a set of 10 sticky dots and we’re told to stick one or two next to features they particularly liked from the sketches. In this way, standout features were highlighted by clusters of dots.</p>\n<p>(figure set:voting)</p>\n<p>Viv then lead a round of Q&amp;A where we’d discuss the standout features. As the decider, she then made the call on which features would progress to design stage. I noted these down as a set of requirements.</p>\n<p>Finally, we created a final set of sketches as a team (with one person designated as the “scribe”) that combined all the features into a coherent user journey.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>This type of small, well-defined problem <em>is</em> solvable in a day. What we didn’t do is square the circle, i.e., test our solution with users. That’s a definite problem. We plan on creating interactive prototypes during the design stage which we’ll test with teachers.</p>\n<p>I predict this won’t turn-up too many surprises as we’ve not deviated too far from an established pattern. But this is definitely worth thinking about earlier for more complex problems or brand-new features.</p>\n<p>On a practical level we were also able to refine the “short-sprint” process for the next time: Chopping out the bits that didn’t yield anything useful and providing better explanations around the bits that confused people.</p>\n<p>We would’ve also liked to invite some guest experts from other areas of the business, we’ll definitely do this next time.</p>\n<h2>Where next?</h2>\n<p>Finding a balance between the full methodology as set out in the book, and a process we can use many times in quick succession is tricky. Cherry-picking <em>is</em> something the book suggests: You can remove day five, and do testing as a separate process without the need for the whole team. However, we deconstructed the sprint to its bare-bones, and I’m not convinced we didn’t loose… <em>something</em>.</p>\n<p>But, Firefly-flavoured Design Sprints are definitely here to stay. We’ve already booked-in longer sprints to help us solve slightly bigger problems, and allow us to include more of the methodology. We’ll refine them over time, cherry-picking the bits that work best for us.</p>\n<p>The culture of fail-early is one that we’re committed to. At the heart of this is getting features into the hands of clients as early as possible, listening to their feedback, and quickly delivering the next iteration. Design Sprints are just one way of doing this.</p>\n"},{"title":"The road to Firefly 6, part 2","date":"2017-01-23T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["Firefly","design"],"images":[{"image":"anna-and-danielle.jpg","caption":"Anna and Danielle discuss the relative merits of button patterns in the old Firefly office, October 2015","set":"anna"},{"image":"markbook.jpg","caption":"The Firefly Markbook, showing some example data from our training class.","set":"markbook"}],"filename":"60","content":"<p>This is part two of a two part article all about building Firefly 6 and the lessons we learned along the way.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"/articles/59\">part one</a> we took whistle stop tour of the year-and-a-half it took to design and build Firefly 6. This time I’m going to talk about some the front-end technology and practices we used to help us build more robust software.</p>\n<h2>We built a pattern library</h2>\n<p>Until Firefly 6, it was usual practice to build features one-by-one. There was little re-use of code, meaning if we found a bug with an element, then we’d have to fix it multiple times.</p>\n<p>What we needed was a pattern library! In October we were joined for a few days by Anna Debenham who literally wrote the book on <a href=\"http://www.maban.co.uk/projects/front-end-style-guides/\">front-end style guides</a> to help us catalogue Firefly’s user interface.</p>\n<p>(figure set:anna)</p>\n<p>We used this to build a “single source of truth” library of interface elements. This means that Firefly is now essentially built from a kit of parts. If we need a button, we can just call one in from the library. Even better, if we find a bug with the button, we can fix it once, and its fixed everywhere. Much faster and a lot more robust.</p>\n<p>I also have to mention <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniellehuntrods/\">Danielle Huntrods</a>, a contractor who worked with us for almost a year, during which she built the majority of the of the pattern library. It was her brilliance that gave us such a solid foundation for the future.</p>\n<p>We plan (at some point) to release a publicly accessible version of the pattern library. This is part of our ongoing commitment to openness and giving back to the web community. Hopefully others will find what we’ve done useful.</p>\n<h2>We flattened the cascade</h2>\n<p>Cascading Style Sheets, or CSS, is the language that allows us to define the visual appearance of web pages. Firefly uses quite a lot of it.</p>\n<p>CSS uses something called a “Cascade”, meaning that elements can inherit their style from other elements that use the same HTML. For example:</p>\n<pre><code>button {\n    background-color: blue;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Means all <code>button</code> elements on the page would have a blue background.</p>\n<p>However if you wanted to make one red, you can give it a name, and use that name in the CSS to override the background colour to red. Useful and straightforward enough.</p>\n<p>However, The problem with this comes when you have thousands of elements. Sometimes, when you style one element, because of the way CSS cascades, you inadvertently style another element you didn’t mean to.</p>\n<p>We solve this at Firefly by using a way of writing CSS called BEM, or Block Element Modifier. This allows us to effectively remove the cascade by using a naming system that guarantees that  you only ever style the specific element you meant to.</p>\n<p>This is great for us at Firefly, as it means we ship far less styling bugs. And it makes it easy for us to fix those bugs that do slip through, knowing that we’re not going to accidentally  cause more bugs elsewhere.</p>\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/\">read more about BEM here</a>, on the excellent CSS Tricks website.</p>\n<h2>We became more Reactive</h2>\n<p>Firefly makes heavy use of the other great language of the web: Javascript. This is the technology that allows us to manipulate the interface in real-time, without having to reload the page every time you take any action within Firefly.</p>\n<p>To help us write better Javascript, we’ve stared using a library called <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/react/\">React</a>. React was developed by Facebook to solve some of the challenges they were facing when building their website.</p>\n<p>To understand why this is good for Firefly, lets look at a practical example of a feature we introduced in Firefly 5: The Markbook.</p>\n<p>The Markbook is a highly interactive screen with lots of different states. We use Javascript to manage these states. However, this is where things get complicated very quickly. The developer must remember to update <em>all</em> the states when the user interacts with <em>any</em> of the states.</p>\n<p>For example, opening one popup will need to close any others. As you add more and more states, this compounds the problem. This is the source of many bugs, as developers can’t keep all these things in their heads all at once.</p>\n<p>(figure set:markbook)</p>\n<p>React manages states for you, by keeping its own internal copy of the page’s HTML, (what’s known as the Document Object Model, or DOM). It continually compares <em>its</em> model  to the real DOM that’s shown to the user, and updates it on the fly.</p>\n<p>In this way, things like closing one popup when another is opening can be controlled by one simple rule, and React handles the rest. This is leads to less bugs and happier users.</p>\n<p>We make use of React in the new Task Details screen, where teachers can mark student’s work in a variety of ways. This screen has hundreds of different states, all managed reliably by React.</p>\n<h2>We simplified our themes offering</h2>\n<p>This was perhaps the most controversial changes we made with made in Firefly 6. We did this to improve the user experience of the majority of users in Firefly, but quite understandably some schools were disgruntled when they discovered that we were retiring Columnist and Angular. We were also removed support for a number of custom themes we’d built for some of our long-standing clients.</p>\n<h3>Fewer bugs</h3>\n<p>Themes have always been the source of front-end bugs within Firefly. Each theme has its own HTML with which it “wraps” standard Firefly elements (like resource page content, or the Markbook for example). It also has its own CSS with which it will restyle the standard Firefly elements.</p>\n<p>This means that when we release new feature or updates existing ones, we also have to update the themes. The more themes, the more updates we have to do. Obviously, this model doesn’t scale well. So we’ve reduced the number of themes we offer to ensure that when we release updates, we can ensure that all our schools have a great experience.</p>\n<h3>Theme Variables</h3>\n<p>What about theme customisation? Many schools want to inject their personality into the tools they use every day. In Firefly 5 we introduced <strong>Theme Variables</strong> to do just this. We improved them in Firefly 6 (more about that later), but its worth covering the basics:</p>\n<p>Firefly uses a CSS pre-processor called <em><a href=\"http://lesscss.org/\">Less</a></em>. This allows us to store colours as variables, and manipulate them programatically. For example, Melody has a variable called <code>@background-colour</code>, thats used in different places throughout the interface. <em>Less</em> allows you to use an array of <a href=\"http://lesscss.org/functions/#color-operations\">colour operation functions</a> to do things like darken or lighten colours. This is particularly useful for creating a harmonious colour scheme.</p>\n<p>We also use <em>Less</em> to check the relative contrast between two colours. For example, lets say we have a box, styled like this:</p>\n<pre><code>.box {\n    background-colour: @background-colour;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>We’d want to check that any text that’s put inside that box is legible. We can do this with <em>Less</em> by checking the contrast of two alternative colours <em>against</em> a background colour, and using the one which is most legible, like so:</p>\n<pre><code>.box {\n    background-colour: @background-colour;\n    color: contrast(@background-colour, black, white);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>All of which means that, per school, we can override these core variables with school colours, and be assured that the interface will still look great, and all text will be legible.</p>\n<h3>Better theme options</h3>\n<p>We’ve done a lot of work in Firefly 6 to improve and streamline the Theme Variables. Each theme now only requires a small set of colours. Every other colour used within the interface is based-off this core set.</p>\n<p>We’ve also removed a number of theme options that weren’t really adding much value for schools. For instance, lots of schools told us that they didn’t really care about things like background patterns, or changing fonts. We now use smart defaults instead.</p>\n<p>We’ve paved the way to style more of the interface based-off the schools’ colour choices in the future, all in a way that will work with feature updates we make.</p>\n<h2>Wrapping up</h2>\n<p>I hope you’ve found these couple of articles interesting. We like to be as open as possible about the way we build software. Hopefully this has given you an insight into the internal workings here at Firefly, and the things we’ve done to ensure we’re delivering the absolute best product possible.</p>\n"},{"title":"The road to Firefly 6, part 1","date":"2017-01-16T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["Firefly","design"],"images":[{"image":"big-red-button.jpg","caption":"Robin, Viv and I gather around the beautifully designed button to activate Firefly 6 in our offices in Hammersmith, 12th December 2016","set":"A"},{"image":"me-user-testing.jpg","caption":"Me doing some user testing at the Firefly Learning Conference in Birmingham, November 2016","set":"testing"},{"image":"sketching.jpg","caption":"An early sketch from a sketching workshop we ran at  the Firefly offices","set":"testing"},{"image":"team-firefly.jpg","caption":"Almost all of Team Firefly at the Firefly Learning Conference in Birmingham, 15th November 2016","set":"team"},{"image":"office-1.jpg","caption":"Firefly’s new offices at the Aircraft Factory, Hammersmith.","set":"office"},{"image":"office-2.jpg","caption":"Joe’s old Raleigh Firefly bike in pride of place at the Firefly offices in Hammersmith, October 2016","set":"office"}],"filename":"59","content":"<p>Recently, Robin, Viv and I had the honour of pushing the (literal) big red button that would enable our clients to upgrade to Firefly 6. Champaign corks were popped and pizza was enjoyed by the whole team before we, very quickly, very diligently, returned to work.</p>\n<p>(figure set:A)</p>\n<p>Now seems like a good point to pause, and look back on the past eighteen months and the changes we made to our team, technology and working practices that enabled us to release the biggest step-change in Firefly to date.</p>\n<p>I’ve broken this article into two parts: This first part starts with journey in time from the deep dark past of April 2015 right up to the present day. We learned a lot about <em>how</em> to build great software in this time, so I’ll talk about that at the end.</p>\n<p>In part two (spoiler alert) I’ll talk about the changes we made to our technology stack and our design and front-end development teams.</p>\n<h2>Spring/Summer 2015</h2>\n<p>Back in April 2015 we knew <em>roughly</em> what teachers, students and parents wanted from the next version of Firefly. However, there was still lots of work to do to refine our ideas into a definite, focused list of features that would work for everyone.</p>\n<p>As Head of Product, Viv ran a number of discovery workshops with teachers, students and parents from a large number of our schools. Armed with this research, our UX team was able to start sketching solutions from which we could create interactive product mock-ups. These were then tested with more users, refined, and tested again.</p>\n<p>(figure set:testing)</p>\n<p>We didn’t just limit this discovery phase to the start of the project, we continued to conduct user research at every stage. We’re lucky that our clients don’t mind acting as guinea pigs and let us test all our crazy new ideas on them. We also engaged an agency to connect with non-client teachers, students and parents, to ensure that the new features would work for everyone, not just those used to Firefly already.</p>\n<h2>Autumn/Winter 2015</h2>\n<p>While research and design were progressing nicely, thoughts turned to a busy conference season. With the Firefly Learning Conference just around the corner and Bett looming, we knew we needed something more tangible than interactive mock-ups to show people.</p>\n<p>Bett, in particular, would be the first time clients and prospects alike could get hands-on with the new Firefly. We had to build a demo version of Firefly that would work well enough to give prospective clients a taste of what was to come in Firefly 6, that would also be robust enough to work with the WiFi in the ExCel centre.</p>\n<p>In a sterling effort by all involved, we cut a demo-ready version of Firefly less than 24 hours before the start of the show. Despite there being a few bits of hidden sticky-tape and string holding everything together, we had an amazingly successful Bett. The demo stood up to anyting our stand visitors threw at it, and I think its fair to say that everyone was suitably wowed.</p>\n<h2>Spring/Summer 2016</h2>\n<p>At the Firefly Learning Conference in November we’d confidently told our clients that they could expect Firefly 6 in the summer term. By the spring it was apparent that we couldn’t meet this deadline and release a version of Firefly that was of sufficient quality. So we took the difficult decision to delay the release to the next logical point where schools would have a chance to install it in-between terms: Christmas.</p>\n<p>In the summer we we’re able to release the new navigation, and because it was now in the hands of schools quickly iterate it based on feedback from a large group of users. As with all changes, it was met with a mixed reception, but the vast majority of users loved the changes we’d made.</p>\n<h2>Autumn/Winter 2016</h2>\n<p>We were now nearing the end of our development phase. A significant portion of both the web app and native iOS and Android apps had now been completed. We were on target for our completion date of 28th November, which would give us 2 weeks to do final testing before launch on 12th December.</p>\n<p>Building software is hard; Building great software is very hard. So it was understandable that the final few weeks before our production deadline was filled with late nights and many take-outs in the office.</p>\n<p>It is a testament to the diligent work of everyone involved that we brought this incredible new version in on time. Not just the team who built the software, but also the support, client experience, sales and marketing teams. They’re all responsible in equal part for Firefly 6.</p>\n<p>(figure set:team,class:span-both)</p>\n<h2>Please release me, let me go</h2>\n<p>Even the most old school software companies release their software more often than every 18 months, so why did we take a year-and-a-half to release Firefly 6?</p>\n<p>Well, the reality is that we were releasing, every two weeks in fact. We shipped <strong>35</strong> versions from <code>5.2.1</code> in April 2015 to <code>6.0.1</code> on 12th December 2016. These releases included a large number of bug fixes, and lots of new features and tweaks to existing features.</p>\n<p>So why was 6 such a big release? Well, this was such a step change that there were several Epics that wouldn’t make sense in isolation. For example, the new <em>Set A Task</em> flow allows teachers to create rich tasks with far more flexibility than tasks they could create in Firefly 5. Releasing this without any ability for students to respond to these tasks, or teachers then to mark the response was simply unfeasible.</p>\n<h2>Things we learned and changes we made</h2>\n<p>We’ve certainly have learned a thing or two along the way, not least that we need more development resource, but having just landing the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/15/firefly-takes-5-6m-series-a-for-its-learning-support-platform-for-schools/\">largest Series A investment</a> in Education Technology in the UK, we’re certainly now in a position to do that.</p>\n<p>It wouldn’t have been possible to build such complex software with a relatively small team without some smart ways of working. Over the last year-and-a-half we’ve made some big changes to the way we work, these help us work faster and release less bugs.</p>\n<h3>We established Epics, Squads and Guilds</h3>\n<p>We spilt sets of features up into logic chunks. These, we call <strong>Epics</strong>. An Epic is a set of features that makes sense end-to-end. For example, the new task setting flow was a single Epic. This included all the backend logic, and user interface elements for teachers, parents and students.</p>\n<p>Each Epic is owned by team called a <strong>Squad</strong>. A Squad is a self contained unit of UX’ers, Designers, Developers and a manager. Everyone who’s needed to research, design, build, refine and manage workflow for that one Epic.</p>\n<p>There are parts of the product that are relevant to more than one Squad. For example, the Pattern Library is used by all squads working on the Firefly web interface. To manage changes and updates to these areas we have <strong>Guilds</strong>. Typically a Guild will contain a representative from each Squad, and meet on an ad-hoc basis when changes are needed.</p>\n<h3>We moved</h3>\n<p>It would be remiss of me not to mention our new office. In October we moved from Lyric Square to the Aircraft Factory, in Hammersmith. We now have an amazing space that feels far more attuned to building brilliant software. We even have Joe’s old Raleigh Firefly bike (the inspiration for the name) in pride of place above his desk.</p>\n<p>(figure set:office)</p>\n<h3>We established the Nine Rules</h3>\n<p>I think what we’ve learned can be distilled into a set of principles that we’ve refined throughout this project. These are <strong>Firefly’s Nine Rules:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Frequent tasks should be easy and occasional tasks achievable</strong>. Teachers are incredibly busy, don’t give them a vast array of options.</li>\n<li><strong>Use smart defaults.</strong> We make good choices, so users don’t have to.</li>\n<li><strong>Don’t make me think.</strong> Make the next action obvious and unambiguous. Reduce unnecessary choices.</li>\n<li><strong>Beautiful by default.</strong> Teachers want to be proud of the things they create, so make this easy for them,</li>\n<li><strong>Optimise.</strong> Firefly should be fast.</li>\n<li><strong>Do less.</strong> Firefly should do a core set of things extremely well.</li>\n<li><strong>Design for teaching, not content management.</strong> Firefly isn’t a content management system, its a learning tool.</li>\n<li><strong>Right feature at the right moment.</strong> Too many options are confusing, be smart about when we expose a new feature.</li>\n<li><strong>Firefly isn’t just used in school</strong> Users should be able to achieve their task, no matter their location.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Where next?</h3>\n<p>Its an exciting time for Firefly. We’re expanding our team, and we’re brimming with ideas for the future. We’re working closely with a wide array of our clients to shape the next iteration of Firefly. There won’t be a large release for a while, but that’s exciting in itself, it means we’re going to work on smaller features that we can get into your hands quicker. I, for one, can’t wait to see what the next eighteen months brings.</p>\n"}]},{"name":"Design","count":1,"items":[{"title":"Design sprints at Firefly","date":"2017-02-13T00:00:00.000Z","images":[{"image":"the-squad.jpg","caption":"The communications squad works on solutions for a more flexible navigation in Firefly","set":"squad"},{"image":"early-sketching.jpg","caption":"Aegir creating some early ideas in the first sketching activity","set":"sketching"},{"image":"voting.jpg","caption":"Zannah casts her vote for a part of a solution she particularly likes.","set":"voting"}],"tags":["Firefly","Design"],"filename":"61","content":"<p>Sketching has always been essential part of what we do at Firefly.

You may also invite an expert from finance and marketing as well as members from the tech and design teams.</p>\n<p>A plan for the week might look like this:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr><th>Day</th><th>Outline</th></tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td>Monday</td><td>Understanding the challenge and decide what problem you’re trying to solve</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Tuesday</td><td>A number of different sketching activities to fully explore potential solutions</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Wednesday</td><td>The whole team presents and votes on solutions from Tuesday.</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Thursday</td><td>Creating a prototype of a chosen solution.</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Friday</td><td>Testing your prototype with real users and gathering feedback.</td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>What’s the benefit for Firefly?</h2>\n<p>We’ve been getting excited about Design Sprints for a while. The mantra of “fail early” is especially useful as it helps us to stay agile in a fast-paced market place.</p>\n<p>We’ve always listened closely to what teachers, students and parents want, but understanding exactly what they’ll find genuinely useful is rather more difficult.</p>\n<p>A process like Design Sprints helps us get our ideas in-front of customers at the earliest possible opportunity, and find out if what we <em>think</em> they want is actually useful, without going through the long process of design, build and QA first.</p>\n<h2>Our experience</h2>\n<p>We already had a very well defined problem, namely how to give schools greater flexibility in their Firefly navigation. In the sprint we’d set out to design both the updated navigation and the administration interface that would allow site administrators to customise the menu.</p>\n<p>I ran the day, as the “facilitator”. Viviana, our product manager, was the “decider”. The Communications squad (a cross-discipline team who would be building the feature) were our sketching team.</p>\n<p>We used a number of the activities from the Design Sprints book, together with a mix of activities from elsewhere that we thought would enable us to solve this problem in a day.</p>\n<h3>Jobs to be done</h3>\n<p>Before the sprint, Viv created a list of <strong>jobs to be done</strong>. Based directly from feedback, these are a way to think about tasks that users want to achieve. They’re written in a way so as the focus is on the task rather than a particular technology or solution, an example of this might be:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When organising the school’s Firefly pages, I want to be able to divide pages into highly visible sections, so I can make it easier to find content that is relevant for students, parents and teachers and show off the content we have.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Sketching</h3>\n<p>We went through a number of sketching exercises, first creating quick low fidelity sketches to flesh-out some early ideas. Then we moved on to creating more detailed sketches that detailed a whole user journey.</p>\n<p>(figure set:sketching)</p>\n<h3>Arriving at a solution</h3>\n<p>After each of the team had taken it in turns to present their sketch, we moved onto a round of <strong>heat mapping</strong>. Everyone was given a set of 10 sticky dots and we’re told to stick one or two next to features they particularly liked from the sketches. In this way, standout features were highlighted by clusters of dots.</p>\n<p>(figure set:voting)</p>\n<p>Viv then lead a round of Q&amp;A where we’d discuss the standout features. As the decider, she then made the call on which features would progress to design stage. I noted these down as a set of requirements.</p>\n<p>Finally, we created a final set of sketches as a team (with one person designated as the “scribe”) that combined all the features into a coherent user journey.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>This type of small, well-defined problem <em>is</em> solvable in a day. What we didn’t do is square the circle, i.e., test our solution with users. That’s a definite problem. We plan on creating interactive prototypes during the design stage which we’ll test with teachers.</p>\n<p>I predict this won’t turn-up too many surprises as we’ve not deviated too far from an established pattern. But this is definitely worth thinking about earlier for more complex problems or brand-new features.</p>\n<p>On a practical level we were also able to refine the “short-sprint” process for the next time: Chopping out the bits that didn’t yield anything useful and providing better explanations around the bits that confused people.</p>\n<p>We would’ve also liked to invite some guest experts from other areas of the business, we’ll definitely do this next time.</p>\n<h2>Where next?</h2>\n<p>Finding a balance between the full methodology as set out in the book, and a process we can use many times in quick succession is tricky. Cherry-picking <em>is</em> something the book suggests: You can remove day five, and do testing as a separate process without the need for the whole team. However, we deconstructed the sprint to its bare-bones, and I’m not convinced we didn’t loose… <em>something</em>.</p>\n<p>But, Firefly-flavoured Design Sprints are definitely here to stay. We’ve already booked-in longer sprints to help us solve slightly bigger problems, and allow us to include more of the methodology. We’ll refine them over time, cherry-picking the bits that work best for us.</p>\n<p>The culture of fail-early is one that we’re committed to. At the heart of this is getting features into the hands of clients as early as possible, listening to their feedback, and quickly delivering the next iteration. Design Sprints are just one way of doing this.</p>\n"}]},{"name":"drawing","count":2,"items":[{"title":"I made some Christmas cards","date":"2016-12-14T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["drawing"],"images":[{"image":"christmas-cards-2016.jpg","caption":"Some Christmas cards, wot I made","set":"cards"}],"filename":"58","content":"<p>(figure set:cards,class:pull-both)</p>\n<p>I tried my hand at watercolour and created some Christmas cards.

It was great! It had a gated pool, and all the toys the child could ever want. It was also close to beaches, restaurants and interesting places to visit.</p>\n<p>The weather was a bit of a mixed bag, we had a few nice days, but if you like it hot (Like I do) then mid-October isn’t really the time to visit Portugal. It certainly wasn’t warm enough to heat the solar-powered pool heater. I went in a few times, but it was too cold for Katie and <em>Roo</em>.</p>\n<h2>Striking a balance</h2>\n<p>Every now and again I have a moment where it dawns on me that we have a child now, and our lives will never be the same again. Our first family holiday was one of those moments. Gone were the late night meals-out and morning lay-ins of holidays gone by. We could no longer plan days out that consisted purely of thing that Katie and I wanted to do. We had a little head to consider.</p>\n<h2>Things we liked</h2>\n<p>I think we managed to strike a balance, and found activities that we all enjoyed. <em>Roo</em> (for the most part) was happy to go with the flow, and enjoyed exploring new places.</p>\n<p>Here’s some of the things we liked in and around Caldas da Rainha.</p>\n<h3>Food</h3>\n<p>The Portuguese all seemed to love children, so made eating out at lunch extremely easy. There were excellent restaurants almost  everywhere we went, but a personal favourite was the vegetarian restaurant <a href=\"http://maratona.tv/\">Maratona</a> in the centre of Caldas. They were brilliant with <em>Roo</em>, rushing through an order of chips to prevent the inevitable mealtime meltdown.</p>\n<p>(figure set:maratona)</p>\n<h3>Exploring</h3>\n<p>We were delighted to find that <em>Roo</em> didn’t mind mooching around villages and towns. She was fascinated by the shops full of (mainly tile-based) gifts. As long as she was fed and could enjoy the occasional ice cream she was happy.</p>\n<p>The monastery at Albobaça was a particular favourite, with it’s large stone rooms. She loved hearing her footsteps and voice echoing down the corridors, <em>“echo, Mummy!”</em></p>\n<p>(figure set:monastery,class:span-both)</p>\n<p>We also really liked \u000fÓbidos, a fortified city that dates back to the 13th century. She loved the shops, castle and ice cream. We loved exploring the castle walls, the wonderful weather and the local cherry liqueur that you drink from a chocolate cup.</p>\n<h3>Lisbon Oceanarium</h3>\n<p>She <em>loved</em> the Oceanarium in Lisbon. We did have to queue a little for tickets (top tip: book online before you go) but the efficient staff meant our wait was fairly short.</p>\n<p>I would love to know what she was thinking as she stared up at the double-floor height tank full, packed to the <em>gills</em> with all kind of fish. Its difficult to know what goes through that little head, but she chatted about <em>“fsh”</em> all the way back to the Villa.</p>\n<p>(figure set:oceanarium)</p>\n<h3>Buddha Eden</h3>\n<p>The Buddha Eden in Bombarral is an amazing place. Set in 30 acres of beautiful gardens are hundreds of sculptures from all over Asia. <em>Roo</em> loved the wide open spaces and all the huge sculptures. There’s also some well times cafés where we were able to refuel while <em>Roo</em> had a sleep in her push-chair.</p>\n<p>(figure set:buddha)</p>\n<h3>Beaches, parks and gardens</h3>\n<p>Besides all the things we paid money for, there were plenty of free things that we enjoyed too. There is a beautiful park in Caldas that was a big hit with <em>Roo</em>, full of amazing green spaces, a lovely play-park and a couple of nice cafés.</p>\n<p>There’s also some really great beaches in this area, which were deserted when we visited, it being so late in the year. The sea was freezing, but that didn’t stop <em>Roo</em> enjoying a paddle.</p>\n<p>(figure set:park)</p>\n<h2>Things we didn’t like as much</h2>\n<p>The flight home was a bit rubbish. We’d stayed in a hotel at the airport the night before, but hadn’t really thought through the night sharing a room with <em>Roo</em>. So, between a disturbed night in a strange room and the 4:30am start to get our early flight its fair to say that <em>Roo</em> wasn’t in the best of moods.</p>\n<p>Halfway home, in order to placate our struggling child, Katie had taken her on a walk down the isle to visit the cabin crew. While there she decided to vomit over the side of the plane and several unsuspecting passengers. Tiredness had gotten the better of her.</p>\n<h2>In summary</h2>\n<p>We had a brilliant time in Portugal, we’d thoroughly recommend it as a holiday destination with a small child. It was different, for sure, but I think we made it work, and made some more happy memories with the <em>Roo</em>.</p>\n"}]},{"name":"politics","count":1,"items":[{"title":"We need to talk about Europe","date":"2016-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["politics"],"images":[{"image":"we-need-to-talk-about-europe.jpg","caption":"A badly drawn EU flag, in tatters","set":"default"}],"filename":"55","content":"<p>Like many of my friends, I was shocked by the results of last weeks referendum about Britain’s future in Europe. I spent the majority of the last week feeling angry, let down and increasingly lied-to, as more revelations about the leave campaign’s plan, or lack of it, came to light. But, there’s a kind of catharsis in writing, so I’ve decided to recount some of my thoughts about Brexit here, uninformed as they may be.</p>\n<p>(figure set:default)</p>\n<p>When I went to bed on Thursday night, Gibraltar had just voted overwhelmingly to remain. No surprises there. My wife Katie, and our daughter, were away for a couple of nights and I’d decided to get an early night without the possibility of being woken by a little voice in the night. When my alarm woke me at six-thirty, I immediately checked my phone. I couldn’t believe it. How could this have happened?</p>\n<p>But why should I feel so angry, when only a few weeks ago I couldn’t make up my mind which way to vote? When the referendum was first announced, I’d just assumed I’d vote to remain. I suppose I’m of that generation that doesn’t have a concept of the empire, or Britain being great. I’ve lived all my life in a country who’s best days were supposedly behind it. So being part of Europe, being part of that culture, history and having hope for a united future is incredibly attractive.</p>\n<p>But then I listened to the arguments to leave: That we’d be better off by electing our own law-makers; That we’d save £350million a week; That the European Union is on the verge of collapse anyway, and I started to doubt my convictions.</p>\n<p>It was only when I started to <em>really</em> think about these claims, and read a little deeper into them did I decide that my gut instincts were right: The EU may be far from perfect, but if these were the sort of lies the leave campaign had to employ in order to persuade me, then, on balance, we’d be better off remaining. In other ways too, staying part of Europe, having a seat at the negotiating table, felt like the better choice to me. I wanted our future to be open, not closed off.</p>\n<h2>Brexit fallout</h2>\n<p>The Brexit fallout was swift. Our policy makers quickly fell into old patterns of in-party fighting and back-stabbing. No one has yet really set out a plan for what we do next beyond a few platitudes designed to reassure, but ultimately saying nothing. I have a horrible feeling that both main parties haven’t a clue what to do next. Even worse still, there seems to be something rotten at the heart of the Conservative party that is yet to come to light. What is clear, though, is that the old party divisions don’t work any more.</p>\n<p>The country is divided: “We are the 48%” chant those marching on London in protest at what was ultimately a fair democratic result. “Cry babies” comes the reply from the leave camp. It’s a mess. Darkest of all is the actions of a few who think this result means that half the country just gave them carte blanche to air their bullshit racist rhetoric.</p>\n<p>Beyond our borders, it seems that exiting the EU will have little to no effect on migrants entering Britain. And why would it? We’re completely reliant on foreign works to shore-up our essential services. What our exit does is send the wrong message of &quot;You’re not welcome here&quot;. It remains to be seen how this will play out, but we may have just alienated a large group of people we rely upon every day.</p>\n<h2>Liar, liar</h2>\n<p>Perhaps the hardest pill for those on both sides of the debate was the way in which our exit was won. It’s abundantly clear that many politicians aren’t above telling bold-faced lies in order to secure a result.</p>\n<p>This, for me, is the most unbelievable fact of UK politics. How can it be right for those we’re supposed to trust with governing our lives to openly lie to us? Perhaps I’m misunderstanding the situation, but this seems completely crazy.</p>\n<h2>Where now?</h2>\n<p>This whole sorry affair has highlighted some home truths: I’ve never been particularly interested in politics. I never know the policies of those standing in local elections, I just vote based on some loose affiliation with the party my parents support. This is, admittedly, totally unacceptable.</p>\n<p>Talking with friends, I was not surprised that many of them feel the same way. I don’t think it’s totally our fault though. The main parties in this country often say roughly the same things. It seems they have old policies that seek to fulfil the goals of the party 30 years ago, but are irrelevant today. No wonder its hard to choose between them.</p>\n<p>For my part, and for many friends, Brexit came as a shock. I’m hoping we can use it for positive change in the way we approach those that would seek public office — and our role in electing them. I’m striving to become more informed, and with information comes power to make the right choices for a better future for Britain.</p>\n"}]},{"name":"education technology","count":1,"items":[{"date":"2015-10-22T00:00:00.000Z","title":"The future of technology in the classroom","tags":["education technology"],"filename":"53","content":"<p>One of the things I spend a lot of time thinking about is education; or, more specifically the use of technology in education. I’m not a teacher, but I do work for a tech company whose goal it is to make education better.</p>\n<p>Recently the <a href=\"https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/frequent-use-school-computers-impairs-learning-finds-international\"><abbr title=\"Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\">OECD</abbr> released a report</a> that suggested that the use of technology in the classroom was having a detrimental effect on how well pupils were performing in standardised tests. As an organisation who really takes the time to try and understand education, Firefly certainly had a few thoughts on the report. One of our founders, Joe Mathewson, <a href=\"http://fireflylearning.com/blog/is-technology-good-or-bad-for-schools\">shared his thoughts on the report</a> on The BBC News Channel.</p>\n<p>As one of the people who designs software  used by hundreds-of-thousands of students, teachers and parents every day I have a responsibility to help build something genuinely useful. What we’re hearing loud-and-clear from teachers is that technology is just another tool, and is only useful when used alongside other tools and teaching methods.</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CatScutt\">Cat Scutt</a>, Head of Learning Technology and Innovation at the Girls’ Day School Trust, recently commented in her <a href=\"https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-views/yin-and-yang-using-mobile-technology-classroom\">TES article</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[E]ven if we focus on [academic achievement] alone, there is a fundamental flaw here in treating ICT as if it is a pedagogical approach in itself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It’s with this in mind that I’d like to consider what’s next for the classroom. Currently, mobile is the disrupter of the technological status quo. With tablets and phones now ubiquitous, computers have entered every part of the school day. But what happens next is anyones guess; the future is up for grabs. Of course there are indicators of what’s to come, decisions those in the know are making today that <em>may</em> affect the technology of tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Recently, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10101319050523971\">Facebook brought Oculus Rift</a> for $2billion. So why did they invest in a technology that seemed to have died on its arse in the mid 1980s? Well, Mark Zuckerberg certainly seems to be convinced <abbr title=\"Virtual Reality\">VR</abbr> is the next big thing in tech:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We have a lot more to do on mobile, but at this point we feel we’re in a position where we can start focusing on what platforms will come next.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Of course, not everyone is thrilled about Facebook’s acquisition of Oculus, some even suggesting that billionaire Zuckerberg simply loved the device, so he bought the company. However, it’s hard to ignore his vision, and it’s pretty clear what a difference <abbr title=\"Virtual Reality\">VR</abbr> could make to could make to the world beyond just games.</p>\n<p>A world stuffed full of Facebook ads aside, if <abbr title=\"Virtual Reality\">VR</abbr> is due to replace the screen, and change the way we interact with our environment, what does this mean for the classroom?</p>\n<h2>Early adopters</h2>\n<p>An enterprising teacher could, if they wished, start using <abbr title=\"Virtual Reality\">VR</abbr> now. Oculus sell <a href=\"https://www.oculus.com/en-us/dk2/\">Developer kits</a> so those with coding skills can build pretty much any experience they wish.</p>\n<p>Imagine a physics teacher explaining the structure of an atom to their students by immersing them in a world where she’s able to zoom deep into the environment and show the students how the atoms of their desks are arranged. If that sounds far-fetched then have a look at <a href=\"http://tomorrow-projects.com/classroom/\">the tomorrow project</a>, helping school children build their own 3D printable robots.</p>\n<p>I imagine some teachers and parents might see this as the ultimate nightmare scenario for the classroom; rows of students, all wearing goggles, hooked into the schools mainframe. No one speaks as information is simply downloaded into the student’s brain.</p>\n<p>What I’m suggesting here is something quite different. Unlike mobile devices, which by their nature prevent real-world social interactions, Virtual Reality simply adds another layer on top. This augmented reality would support real-world interactions in a way that mobile never can. However, I do think that the success of <abbr title=\"Virtual Reality\">VR</abbr> used in this way will very much depend on how unobtrusive the <abbr title=\"Virtual Reality\">VR</abbr> headsets / glasses / contact lenses can be made.</p>\n<h2>Wider integration</h2>\n<p>I think the mobile revolution has shown us that much of the technology innovation happening in schools is driven by students. Many schools have now adopted one to one or <abbr title=\"Bring Your Own Device\">BYOD</abbr> programmes as a direct kick-back against the tidal wave of devices being brought into school anyway, choosing to utilise technology, rather than have it serve only as a distraction.</p>\n<p>As with anything new, there have been varying levels of success, and the <abbr title=\"Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\">OECD</abbr> report is evidence of that. Personally, I think we’re over the initial hump. Teachers and <abbr title=\"Senior Leadership Teams\">SLTs</abbr> are much more switched on to the potential of mobile computing devices, and their pitfalls. The same will be true of future technology. As <abbr title=\"Virtual Reality\">VR</abbr> becomes more prevalent in everyday life, schools will learn how best to integrate it into their classrooms.</p>\n<h2>Alternative technologies</h2>\n<p>Another technology in its infancy, and one which has huge potential for schools, is smart surfaces. I recently listened to an extremely interesting <a href=\"https://royalsociety.org/stay-in-touch/rss/\">podcast from the Royal Society</a> called &quot;seeing clearly&quot;, in which <a href=\"http://www.phy.cam.ac.uk/directory/dr-dan-credgington\">Dr Dan Credgington</a> gave a brief outline of how we generate light, more specifically how we use <abbr title=\"Light Emitting Diode\">LED</abbr> technology to generate light.</p>\n<p>One of the areas he touched on was future materials, and how LEDs could be used to transform whole surfaces into light producing smart surfaces, and therefore, smart screens. Not only might this improve concentration levels in classrooms (by making the whole ceiling the light we could generate an ambient light level much closer to that of natural sunlight) but we could transform <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodeck\">all surfaces in the classroom into screens</a>.</p>\n<h2>Fanciful imaginings</h2>\n<p>Its fun to imagine what’s next, but for now all of us at Firefly are concentrating on our next set of apps for teachers, students and parents. And, as far as I know, we’ve no plans to release these for Facebook <abbr title=\"Virtual Reality\">VR</abbr> 1.0. At least, not yet anyway.</p>\n"}]},{"name":"web development","count":2,"items":[{"date":"2015-08-28T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Jekyll archives without plugins","tags":["web development","jekyll"],"images":[{"image":"2015-09-01-artwork.jpg","set":"artwork"}],"filename":"51","content":"<p>I recently made the switch to <a href=\"http://jekyllrb.com\">Jekyll</a> as my publishing tool for this website. I love it, not least as it lets me serve content directly from Github. Updating the site is as simple as pushing into my repository. I have no servers to maintain and no extra monthly costs. For a low traffic site it seems, for now at least, like the perfect solution.</p>\n<p>(figure set:artwork)</p>\n<p>To me, one of the most interesting things about writing a blog is the ability to look back, to make old posts new again with an easily navigable archive section. A key part of that is the ‘archives for year …’ page. However, hosting with Github pages means that I can’t use plugins for Jekyll that you’d normally need to achieve this. Jekyll doesn’t really offer much in the way of core functionality for archives, but with a bit of hacking you can create an archive page for every year in a way that doesn’t suck.</p>\n<p>We can use the power of <a href=\"http://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/\">Jekyll collections</a> to <em>somewhat</em> automatically generate an archive page for each year your site has posts. There’s three main parts to the setup:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Configure a collection for archives.</li>\n<li>Create a post for each year for which you want an archive page.</li>\n<li>Create a layout for processing each archive post into <abbr title=\"Hyper Text Markup Language\">HTML</abbr></li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Configure the archives collection</h2>\n<p>First, we need to tell Jekyll about our new collection. In my site configuration file, (usually <code>_config.yml</code>) I added the following:</p>\n<pre><code>collections:\n  archives:\n    output: true\n    permalink: /archives/:path/\n</code></pre>\n<p>This tells Jekyll that we want a collection called <strong>archives</strong>, that we want it to output an <code>index.html</code> for each item in the collection, and we want it to do so under the <code>/archives</code> url.</p>\n<h2>Create a post per year</h2>\n<p>Our new archives collection will read any markdown files in a folder named <code>_archives</code>, so we’ll have to create a post for each year your site has posts in this folder. This is why I say that this method is only <em>somewhat</em> automatic, however we’ll only every have to worry about updating this once per year.</p>\n<p>For example, if we want an archive page for 2015 at <code>archives/2015</code> we’d create the post <code>_archives/2015.md</code>. The only thing that’s really required here is YML front matter, here’s a simplified version of my <code>2015.md</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>---\ntitle: Archives for 2015\nyear: &quot;2015&quot;\nlayout: archive-year\n---\n</code></pre>\n<p>Don’t forget the quotation marks, the reason for them will shortly become apparent.</p>\n<h2>Archive page layout</h2>\n<p>Now we need to define a layout that Jekyll will use to output each archive page. I did this in a layout  <code>_layouts/archive-year.html</code>. Here’s a simplified version of my file:</p>\n<pre><code>---\nlayout: default\n---\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n\n{% for post in site.posts %}\n    {% capture post_year %}{{ post.date | date: '%Y' }}{% endcapture %}\n    {% if post_year == page.year %}\n            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;{{ site.baseurl }}{{ post.url }}&quot;&gt;{{ post.title }}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;       \n    {% endif %}\n{% endfor %}\n\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Its all pretty simple really.

I’d also started freelancing, launching <strong>roodesign</strong> around the same time.</p>\n<p>That was twelve years ago when I was slightly shorter in the tooth and smaller of belly and working for myself, eventually making the move down south, starting full-time in London. All this rather took up my time and thoughts of a personal web project went the same way as oh-so-many pies.</p>\n<p>But a man can dream, and dream I did: first of a CSS3 wonderland with garish colours and effects galore. Then, deciding that blogs were entirely too much hassle, of a stark Neverland consisting purely of some witty paragraph of text and a few links to social networks I hated.</p>\n<p>Eventually I went back to basics and fleshed out exactly what I wanted: Somewhere to write the occasional blog post, showcase my work and post my photographs.</p>\n<h2>Firm foundations</h2>\n<p>I built my first website because it was fun. I then got a job making websites, again because it was enjoyable. I’m lucky that I get paid for what is essentially a hobby. I think that makes me a “professional” but the jury is still out on that one.</p>\n<p>So <em>this</em> site should be the most fun of all, right? I decided to abandon any highfalutin design ideas and just stick to a few core principals that would allow me to grow this site organically.</p>\n<p>First was the logo. I’d been sketching some ideas around a typographic “roo” for a while. A kangaroo was also an obvious choice. The final result is the emblem you see at the top of this page. Not perfect by any means, but a good starting point. I’ll no doubt change it as the site grows.</p>\n<p>(figure set:logo)</p>\n<p>Secondly to start with core elements then work out from there. Creating a pleasant and easy-to-use website is key to this idea, but it’s more than that. By letting the content do the work and keeping the design as subtle as possible I’m striving for (but probably rarely achieving) a browsing experience that feels effortless.</p>\n<p>I’ve chosen <a href=\"http://getkirby.com\">Kirby</a> as my <abbr title=\"Content Management System\">CMS</abbr>, this has so far proven to be the perfect fit, allowing me to write content in the fantastic <a href=\"http://www.iawriter.com\">iA Writer</a> using <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown\">Markdown</a> so I always start with uncluttered, unformatted text.</p>\n<p>And finally, stop procrastination and just launch the bloody thing! I’ve spent entirely too many late nights debugging css to wait any longer. It’s a personal project that’ll grow. So here it is, warts and all.</p>\n"}]},{"name":"jekyll","count":1,"items":[{"date":"2015-08-28T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Jekyll archives without plugins","tags":["web development","jekyll"],"images":[{"image":"2015-09-01-artwork.jpg","set":"artwork"}],"filename":"51","content":"<p>I recently made the switch to <a href=\"http://jekyllrb.com\">Jekyll</a> as my publishing tool for this website. I love it, not least as it lets me serve content directly from Github. Updating the site is as simple as pushing into my repository. I have no servers to maintain and no extra monthly costs. For a low traffic site it seems, for now at least, like the perfect solution.</p>\n<p>(figure set:artwork)</p>\n<p>To me, one of the most interesting things about writing a blog is the ability to look back, to make old posts new again with an easily navigable archive section. A key part of that is the ‘archives for year …’ page. However, hosting with Github pages means that I can’t use plugins for Jekyll that you’d normally need to achieve this. Jekyll doesn’t really offer much in the way of core functionality for archives, but with a bit of hacking you can create an archive page for every year in a way that doesn’t suck.</p>\n<p>We can use the power of <a href=\"http://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/\">Jekyll collections</a> to <em>somewhat</em> automatically generate an archive page for each year your site has posts. There’s three main parts to the setup:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Configure a collection for archives.</li>\n<li>Create a post for each year for which you want an archive page.</li>\n<li>Create a layout for processing each archive post into <abbr title=\"Hyper Text Markup Language\">HTML</abbr></li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Configure the archives collection</h2>\n<p>First, we need to tell Jekyll about our new collection. In my site configuration file, (usually <code>_config.yml</code>) I added the following:</p>\n<pre><code>collections:\n  archives:\n    output: true\n    permalink: /archives/:path/\n</code></pre>\n<p>This tells Jekyll that we want a collection called <strong>archives</strong>, that we want it to output an <code>index.html</code> for each item in the collection, and we want it to do so under the <code>/archives</code> url.</p>\n<h2>Create a post per year</h2>\n<p>Our new archives collection will read any markdown files in a folder named <code>_archives</code>, so we’ll have to create a post for each year your site has posts in this folder. This is why I say that this method is only <em>somewhat</em> automatic, however we’ll only every have to worry about updating this once per year.</p>\n<p>For example, if we want an archive page for 2015 at <code>archives/2015</code> we’d create the post <code>_archives/2015.md</code>. The only thing that’s really required here is YML front matter, here’s a simplified version of my <code>2015.md</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>---\ntitle: Archives for 2015\nyear: &quot;2015&quot;\nlayout: archive-year\n---\n</code></pre>\n<p>Don’t forget the quotation marks, the reason for them will shortly become apparent.</p>\n<h2>Archive page layout</h2>\n<p>Now we need to define a layout that Jekyll will use to output each archive page. I did this in a layout  <code>_layouts/archive-year.html</code>. Here’s a simplified version of my file:</p>\n<pre><code>---\nlayout: default\n---\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n\n{% for post in site.posts %}\n    {% capture post_year %}{{ post.date | date: '%Y' }}{% endcapture %}\n    {% if post_year == page.year %}\n            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;{{ site.baseurl }}{{ post.url }}&quot;&gt;{{ post.title }}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;       \n    {% endif %}\n{% endfor %}\n\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Its all pretty simple really. We’re looping though all the posts on the site, and only displaying them if they match the target year. By the way, those quotation marks from earlier are required for matching the <code>post_year</code> with <code>page.year</code>, which both have to be strings</p>\n<p>And that’s it.

Headphones in, I’m listening to Fink’s “Sort of Revolution” extremely loud and enjoying an ice-cold beer. I lean my head back, and close my eyes against the sun as it dapples through the leaves above me. In the distance are the mountains that circle Lake Garda. Sparse clouds are suspended, seemingly motionless over the azure blue waters. Fuelled by the warmth of the sun, the melodic beat of the music and the haze from the alcohol I feel an almost zen-like sense of well-being. “This is perfect” I thought.</p>\n<p>In contrast to week one, when we’d travelled through five countries, we decided to slow the pace a little. After an epic drive our first stop was the Northern lake town of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nago–Torbole\">Torbole</a>, the windsurfers paradise, and <a href=\"http://www.campingalporto.it/camp/\">Camping Al Porto</a>. It felt Newquay-esq where board-shorts seemed to be the must-have fashion item of the season. The campsite was rather busier than those we’d been used to, but we managed to fit our van and awning on a shaded pitch thirty-seconds walk from the lake.</p>\n<p>(figure set:torbole)</p>\n<p>On the occasion of our first night in Italy, we did what we have the last two trips here: Find the most touristy looking restaurant and order the biggest pizza they have and a glass of the local beer. In this case it was <a href=\"http://www.forst.it/eng\">Forst</a>, brewed “just up the road” we were told.</p>\n<p>The next day we had ideas of taking windsurfing lesson but the wind didn’t seem to want to blow. It was probably too hot, so like us it decided to spend the day sunbathing and exploring the town. We also finally got the BBQ to work despite the crappy “just light the bag” charcoal, thanks to some German firelighters that almost took my face off.</p>\n<p>It was at this point we cheated a little by spending a few nights in a hotel south of the lake in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desenzano_del_Garda\">Desenzano del Garda</a>. “You know” said Katie “I’m loving being able to get out of the shower and being able to keep my feet dry.” I knew what she meant. I’m not proud to admit it but we really did wallow in the luxurious of it all.</p>\n<p>(gallery set:hotel)</p>\n<p>Peeling ourselves away from the hotel pool we ventured down the road to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirmione\">Sirmione</a>. Navigating the spit of land that forms a sort of natural pier into the centre of the southern bank of the lake — we parked and ventured over the bridge into down-town Sirmione. Here we indulged our inner tourist once again by eating gelato and watching the sunset.</p>\n<p>(figure set:sirmione)</p>\n<p>Having made a large dent in our holiday funds we checked out of the hotel and moved north around the lake to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazise\">Lazise</a>. Here we encountered the full glory of the Italian campsite. When you’re a good few kilometres from the centre on the main road you start to notice the signs. At first a just few, then more with increasing ferocity until they line the bank of the lake one after the other. You’re not, as we discovered, just expected to pick one and check-in. We spent an interesting couple of hours driving from site to site inspecting toilet blocks, pools, children’s entertainment and on-site bars before we finally gave in and just picked one.</p>\n<p>(figure set:lazisesite)</p>\n<p>Here we stayed and for four glorious days enjoyed the private beach and exploring the beautiful town. We swam, snorkelled and sunbathed. Ate gelato, pizza and even brought a fridge-magnet. No messing about, this was a proper holiday.</p>\n<p>Alas, it was time to move on. Switzerland and our final week beaconed. We have a week left and just over two-thousand kilometres back to the Euro-tunnel at Calais.</p>\n<p>To be continued…</p>\n"},{"date":"2013-09-07T00:00:00.000Z","title":"European Adventure Week One","section":"articles","introduction":"Being of noble birth Katie and I are taking in the sights of Europe on a three week grand tour","tags":["capervanning","travel","france","germany","austria"],"cover":"/assets/blog/covers/01-20150102233740.jpg","images":[{"image":"alps.jpg","caption":"Driving over the Alps","set":"alps"},{"image":"france.jpg","caption":"Our first night at Camping des Bruyeres","set":"france"},{"image":"adam-night.jpg","caption":"The view from our van at Campingplatz Adam","set":"adam"},{"image":"baden_lunch.jpg","caption":"Lunch in Baden-Baden","set":"baden"},{"image":"salzburg.jpg","caption":"Downtown Salzburg","set":"salzburg"},{"image":"pavilion.jpg","caption":"Katie outside the \"Sixteen Going on Seventeen\" pavilion","set":"pavilion"}],"filename":"41","content":"<p>Being of noble birth Katie and I are taking in the sights of Europe on a three week grand tour.</p>\n<p>However, having a chequebook that is of more moderate means we decided to conduct our trip in our campervan.</p>\n<p>As I write this, we are driving from Salzburg to Lake Garda through the Alps.

I’d also started freelancing, launching <strong>roodesign</strong> around the same time.</p>\n<p>That was twelve years ago when I was slightly shorter in the tooth and smaller of belly and working for myself, eventually making the move down south, starting full-time in London. All this rather took up my time and thoughts of a personal web project went the same way as oh-so-many pies.</p>\n<p>But a man can dream, and dream I did: first of a CSS3 wonderland with garish colours and effects galore. Then, deciding that blogs were entirely too much hassle, of a stark Neverland consisting purely of some witty paragraph of text and a few links to social networks I hated.</p>\n<p>Eventually I went back to basics and fleshed out exactly what I wanted: Somewhere to write the occasional blog post, showcase my work and post my photographs.</p>\n<h2>Firm foundations</h2>\n<p>I built my first website because it was fun. I then got a job making websites, again because it was enjoyable. I’m lucky that I get paid for what is essentially a hobby. I think that makes me a “professional” but the jury is still out on that one.</p>\n<p>So <em>this</em> site should be the most fun of all, right? I decided to abandon any highfalutin design ideas and just stick to a few core principals that would allow me to grow this site organically.</p>\n<p>First was the logo. I’d been sketching some ideas around a typographic “roo” for a while. A kangaroo was also an obvious choice. The final result is the emblem you see at the top of this page. Not perfect by any means, but a good starting point. I’ll no doubt change it as the site grows.</p>\n<p>(figure set:logo)</p>\n<p>Secondly to start with core elements then work out from there. Creating a pleasant and easy-to-use website is key to this idea, but it’s more than that. By letting the content do the work and keeping the design as subtle as possible I’m striving for (but probably rarely achieving) a browsing experience that feels effortless.</p>\n<p>I’ve chosen <a href=\"http://getkirby.com\">Kirby</a> as my <abbr title=\"Content Management System\">CMS</abbr>, this has so far proven to be the perfect fit, allowing me to write content in the fantastic <a href=\"http://www.iawriter.com\">iA Writer</a> using <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown\">Markdown</a> so I always start with uncluttered, unformatted text.</p>\n<p>And finally, stop procrastination and just launch the bloody thing! I’ve spent entirely too many late nights debugging css to wait any longer. It’s a personal project that’ll grow.

The sun was just starting to clear away the early-morning clouds as we wheeled our bikes into Transition. I laid out my kit the best I could then, remebering a tip I’d read on a website, walked around mentally tracing my steps from the swim exit to the bike.</p>\n<p>I really wasn’t sure what to expect, especially when it came to the swim and the water temperature. I’d done a few sea-swims, but the lake was around 12℃, a little colder than I was used to. I needn’t have worried though, despited a little bit of cold-shock I managed to complete the swim in 12m26s, surprisingly in the middle of the field.</p>\n<p>Transition was a weird experience, I <em>did</em> manage to remove my wetsuit without too much falling over myself but then forgot my race belt and had to embarrassingly run back from the mount line to collect it.</p>\n<p>It was such a relief to get the swim and T1 out of the way that I <em>may</em> have gone out a little too fast on the bike. Still I managed to maintain a decent pace and completed the cycle in 57m30s.</p>\n<p>T2 was an altogether more relaxed affair and I was feeling pretty good knowing the end was in sight. I exited transition onto the run corse feeling pretty please with myself.</p>\n<p>(figure set:slateman_1)</p>\n<p>That was until I hit the first climb. I was pleased to see I wasn’t the only one walking and as we went higher the views more than made up for the burning calves. With some really fun, fast downhill sections the run finally led me back past transition to the finish line.

It conjures images of far-flung island chains, sunkissed beaches and ragged shorelines. Twenty-eight miles off the southwestern tip of England is Cornwall’s own archipelago: The Isles of Scilly.</p>\n<p>The islands are a place of contrast. Beautiful yet wild. Bright white beaches nestle alongside sea ravaged cliffs. Windswept hills sit beside sheltered coves and inlets.</p>\n<p>My wife Katie and I have visited many times: With friends; As girlfriend and boyfriend; As husband and wife; And more recently, with our small family.</p>\n<p>This is my love letter to the Islands: A collection of memories from all those trips to Scilly. Out of order and somewhat idealised. The way good memories should be.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>The crossing</h2>\n<p><em>In 2012, Katie and I were due to fly via helicopter, alas it was grounded due to technical difficulty. We had to stay overnight in Penzance and catch the ferry the following day…</em></p>\n<p>Every morning, throughout the summer a passenger ferry departs from the quay in Penzance. Aboard you’ll find serval hundred seats, two cafés and thousands of small white bags in dispensers attached to the bulkheads.</p>\n<p>This is the <em><abbr title=\"Royal Mail Vessel\">RMV</abbr> Scillonian III</em>, and she’s been transporting excited — and occasionally green — tourists from the mainland to the Isles of Scilly since 1977.</p>\n<p>(figure set:scillonian,class:pull-both)</p>\n<p>There are more comfortable ways to get to the Scillies: A small seven-seater plane dubbed <em>Skybus</em> that flies from Lands End, Newquay or Exeter. And, in times past, there was a helicopter that flew from Penzance that was always our favourite way to get to the islands. Alas, this ceased operation at the end of 2012. We were booked on a mid-morning flight, but due to there being a large hole in the side of the helicopter, we were forced to overnight in a nearby hotel to catch the ferry the following day.</p>\n<p>On this particular voyage, we secured our regular spot on the middle deck, near the back door. This is the ideal spot for Katie to sit as motionless as possible and endure any rough crossing.</p>\n<p>Knowing the best thing to do is leave her alone, this position also avails me of an escape route outside to the upper deck. From here, it’s not unusual to spot gigantic shoals of fish or even dolphins in the wake of the engines. In rough water, this is also the optimal location to enjoy the power of the seas. And to keep a weathered eye on the horizon, just in case.</p>\n<p>At capacity, the Scillonian carries 485 souls some of whom line the upper deck like birds on a telephone wire. It’s a busy place to be, people perched atop benches, leaning on the rigging, or hanging over the rails.</p>\n<p>Whatever may come, we’re all now locked together for the two-hours and forty-five-minute trip. Knowing looks are passed over the heads of the unsuspecting day trippers by those of us who’ve travelled this way before. “Poor sods” our brief eye contact seems to say, as we don our pressure point travel bands and pop an array of chemical remedies for <em>mal de mare</em>.</p>\n<p>Luckily, all this preparation is for nought. Once we rounded Gwennap Head off Lands End, and are in full steam towards the islands, most of the more unpleasant effects of the sea are behind us. On a sunny day, there’s no better way to arrive on Scilly than by boat.</p>\n<p>What’s astonishing is the speed at which the passengers disappear once we’ve docked in St Mary’s harbour. Some hang around on the quay waiting for smaller tender boats to the off-islands. Most make the happy walk up the dock, past the Mermaid pub and along Hugh Street, draining off down the various alleyways and lanes to their holiday accommodations.</p>\n<p>At any one time throughout the summer there are thousands of visitors on the islands. And yet, it doesn’t ever feel busy. Scilly is full of secret places, quiet beaches and deserted coves.</p>\n<p>Our journey took us via the <a href=\"https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g488312-d1168609-Reviews-Kavorna_Cafe_Bistro-St_Mary_s_Isles_of_Scilly_England.html\">Kavorna Café</a> (to pick up our first Cornish pasty of the holiday), over Garrison Lane and onto Littleporth to where our friend’s mum has a place that looks out over Porthcressa beach.</p>\n<p>(figure set:view,class:pull-both)</p>\n<p>Naturally, the door is unlocked. Unloading our bags in the doorway, we made our way through the house and out into the garden. Finally, we sank into various bits of unmatched garden furniture and savoured our pasties in silence, taking in the gorgeous view, ready for our holiday to start.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>A lovely day for boating</h2>\n<p><em>In 2017, my wife Katie, daughter “Roo” and I visited Scilly along with our friends Cath and Dave…</em></p>\n<p>“Mummy! I want to get up now!”</p>\n<p>I turned over and looked at my watch. 8:05. Wow, she slept well.</p>\n<p>“Daddy!”</p>\n<p>OK, kid, give me a minute here. But Katie’s already out of bed and padding down the creaky corridor.</p>\n<p>“Shh, you’ll wake Cath and Dave”, I hear Katie tell <em>Roo</em>. Rolling over I caught a glimpse of the sun streaming in at the window. Time to get up.</p>\n<p>“Mummy, we on holy-day”,  <em>Roo</em> confidently tells Katie as they, by degrees, make their way down the corridor. Katie was taking significantly more care than <em>Roo</em>, who skipped down the hall like a demented rabbit.</p>\n<p>I joined my family in the Kitchen. It really was a gorgeous day. A quick check of the BBC’s weather app informed me that it’s a balmy twenty-five degrees with light winds. A lovely day for boating.</p>\n<p>After breakfast we executed our plan: Heading for St Martins. Five of us; intrepid seafarers standing on the quay, tickets in hand watching the <em>Sea King</em> draw alongside the waiting passengers.</p>\n<p>(figure set:seaking,class:pull-both)</p>\n<p>Landing at Higher Town, our first port of call was <a href=\"http://www.theislandbakery-stmartins.com/\">The Island Bakery</a> for the day’s supplies. Fully stocked with Cornish pasties and cola cake, we trundled up the single track road and over the brow of the hill before taking the path cut through a field overgrown with Scilly’s ubiquitous Bracken. The vast swathe of white sand of Great Bay was almost deserted. Besides a few families lounging here and there we’re the only people, so finding a sheltered spot was simple.</p>\n<p>(figure set:digging,class:pull-left)</p>\n<p>Seaside days used to be a relaxed affair but with <em>Roo</em> in tow, it’s now more like mobilising a beach assault. Once the shelter was up, beach mats laid out and sun cream applied, we unpacked the various excavating tools. Thankfully she’s still a bit too small to want to bury daddy, so digging giant holes was the order of the day. <em>Roo</em> took up her position as site foreman then Dave, and I set about our task of digging several large holes and interconnecting trenches. Eventually, the tide will come up and fill this carefully engineered system, much to <em>Roo’s</em> delight, after which Dave and I will have to frantically shore-up walls and rebuild various dams.</p>\n<p>All too soon the site whistle sounds for lunch.</p>\n<p>“Lads! Lunchtime!”</p>\n<p>Sated, crumb covered, and chocolate stained we emerged from lunch. If only <em>Roo</em> can have a nap in the beach shelter, maybe we can have a relaxing hour catching up on some reading. She doesn’t take much coaxing, exhausted from bossing us around she’s happy to sleep.</p>\n<p>One or two of us drifted off too. It’s hard not to in the warmth of the day and with the rhythmic whoosh of the sea lapping at the beach. On waking, I felt the need to burn off all that pasty. It’s was time to break out the wetsuit and snorkel and explore the crystal clear waters.</p>\n<p>Wetsuit, booties, flippers, mask and flippers. All the gear and no idea. Penguin-like, I gingerly waddled my way down to the shoreline and into the freezing waters of the Atlantic. Once waist-deep, I took a big breath and rolled forward into the water. Waiting for the cold water effect to pass, I wrangled the mask into position over my face and entered the underwater world.</p>\n<p>Below the water barrier, I’m in another world entirely. From the beach, I must look like Manatee in distress, but down in my aquatic environment, I felt like Jacques Cousteau about to discover some previously unimagined species.</p>\n<p>Further out the water was clear all the way to the bottom some five meters below, where Kelp forests sheltered shoals of fish. A sudden shot of panic as my lizard brain picked up movement in my peripheral vision: A large striped fish darted out of the Kelp. I followed at a distance. He came to rest in a clearing, and I was able to float above him and just watch for what seemed like an eternity.</p>\n<p>(figure set:snorkel,class:pull-both)</p>\n<p>“I saw a <em>massive</em> fish out there”, I announced to Katie, extending my arms to demonstrate its size, adding a few centimetres in the tradition of men everywhere when talking about the size of things.</p>\n<p>“That’s nice dear”, she replied. “But we need to pack up and go, or we’ll miss the last boat back.”</p>\n<p>Everyone was contemplative on the return to St Mary’s. Even <em>Roo</em> — who was up on her knees so she could see over the side — was uncharacteristically quiet. It was hard not to get lost in that view; the ocean glinting like a blanket of tiny diamonds, the twin islands of St. Agnes and Gugh slung low on the horizon.</p>\n<p><em>Roo</em> was asleep as soon as her head hit the pillow. Perfect, especially as Dave and Cath had kindly offered to babysit.</p>\n<p>A great tradition on our visits to Scilly — perhaps <em>the</em> tradition — is partaking in a scone or two at <a href=\"http://www.julietsgardenrestaurant.co.uk/\">Juliet’s Garden</a>. Perched on top of a hill, the garden offers spectacular views over Tresco. On a warm day, there’s nothing quite like sitting in Juliet’s Garden cramming copious amounts of scone and tea into ones face.</p>\n<p>(figure set:juliets,class:span-both)</p>\n<p>Juliet isn’t just famed for her cream teas, she also runs a fantastic restaurant. On arrival this evening, Katie and I were served drinks in the garden while watching the gorgeous sunset. Then, taking our seats inside, we were treated to an incredible three-course meal.</p>\n<p>As the evening was warm, and our bellies were full we decided to forego a taxi and walk. We sat a while on the flat rock above Town Beach and watched the boat lights bobbing around in the harbour. I don’t think either of us wanted the evening to end. Eventually, though, the lure of bed called us, and we reluctantly slunk back to the house. I often think of that romantic evening on the flat rock as one of my stand out memories of our trip that year. For me, a balmy evening watching small boats on the water <em>is</em> quintessentially Scilly.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>The Scilly Cart, Co.</h2>\n<p><em>In 2014, on our last holiday, before Roo was born, we visited Scilly with our friends Cath, Dave and Emily.</em></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.scillycart.co/\">Scilly Cart Co </a> used to have a Facebook page on which it posted pictures, usually taken by disgruntled locals, of the imperfect parking decisions taken by tourists when hiring a cart for the day. When you arrive at the Cart Co’s depot, you’re greeted with a display board of these photos followed by a pep-talk by the owner on the evils of annoying the locals with where you choose to park.</p>\n<p>(figure set:cart,class:pull-left)</p>\n<p>With these words of warning rising in our ears Dave and I pulled out onto the main road, each of us determined to follow the rules to the letter. How we ended up attempting to break the land-speed record is anyone’s guess. One moment we were driving along sensibly, the next we were bouncing up and down in our seats trying to squeeze every ounce of speed we could from our formula-z cart. Needless to say, we weren’t very successful, and no traffic laws were violated.</p>\n<p>After the girls were aboard, we set out along the Telegraph Road that circles the innards of the island. There was no plan beyond maybe finding a beach and most definitely finding somewhere for lunch. I’ve gotta admit that — despite appearances — driving a golf-buggy is crazy fun. So we kept driving, twice around the island in fact, before we eventually decided we needed some lunch.</p>\n<p>This was the birth of another great tradition: Lunch at <a href=\"http://www.scillycountryhouse.com/about-us/kaffeehaus/\">Kaffeehaus Salbei</a>, a German-inspired café and guesthouse. When it’s hot, and not too busy, you can get a table outside or else swelter inside the conservatory. The German Platter is a must, with homemade bread and Bavarian meats and cheeses. Then, of course, one must have either the Apfelstrudel or — my personal favourite — a slice of Sacher Torte. I swear the cart was noticeably slower after lunch. It was either the weight of the food, or the battery had taken a beating from our multiple laps of the island.</p>\n<p>Locals on the islands often supplement their income by making things, which are offered for sale by the side of the road. An honesty box is provided for you to remunerate the artist for their handiwork. There is such a place on Porth Loo Lane. With time on our hands, we parked the cart and went for a look.</p>\n<p>(figure set:fox,class:pull-right)</p>\n<p>This particular treasure-trove was in the craftsperson’s garden shed. Inside, we found all manner of items. Some cobbled together from flotsam and jetsam. Some reclaimed from household bits and bobs. One thing, in particular, caught Dave’s eye: A fox, made from an old piece of brown carpet. One mad button eye was sewn onto its face, another for its nose. It was beautiful. It was perfect. He had to have it. I think it is a source of great regret that he didn’t buy it there and then. We should have known really, but when we returned later it was already gone. I like to think of it in an ornamental frame, in pride of place above someone’s fireplace. Lucky buggers.</p>\n<p>Later, the cart safely returned with minimal damage, we headed to the Atlantic for dinner and the pub quiz. We were all too drunk (or too stupid) to answer any of the questions well, and “team bum trumpets” inevitably place dead last.</p>\n<p>On any other evening, a night-out on Scilly would end with the closing of the pub. But not tonight, tonight we were off to Barry’s.</p>\n<p>Once a week, Barry opens the doors to his basement for the world famous Barry’s Disco. Imagine the scene: 50 sweaty people dancing the night away in a tiny basement to the hot disco “hits” of the late 90s. God knows what time we finally got out of there. Needless to say, we all had a little lay-in the next morning.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Gigs</h2>\n<p><em>In 2009, without planning to, Katie and I visited St.Mary’s in the same week as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Pilot_Gig_Championships\">World Gig Pilot Gig Championships</a>…</em></p>\n<p>All week, St.Mary’s had been its usual, tranquil place: Little sailing boats had bobbed in the harbour; Gentle winds had blown across the sun-kissed beaches. And the island’s pubs and eateries had no queues at the bar or required bookings for dinner.</p>\n<p>That all changed on Friday morning when the Scillonian docked and brought ashore the first of the revellers who’d come to Scilly to enjoy the weekend’s racing. The Isles of Scilly Steamship Company runs the Scillonian twice-a-day on Gig weekends, dumping several thousand people on the islands in quick succession.</p>\n<p>The whole character of the island was transformed. Pubs, who’d obtained exclusive licences for the occasion, remained open 24-hours a day for the duration. There was a not-so-small minority of people who were here for the weekend, but hadn’t anywhere to stay, electing instead to spend their entire time in the boozer.</p>\n<p>This didn’t dent the enjoyment, far from it. Experiencing this new aspect of Scilly was exciting. Everyone was very jolly, and even a weekend fuelled by alcohol and little sleep didn’t seem to dampen their enthusiasm for cheering on their team.</p>\n<p>If you’re not familiar, a Cornish Pilot Gig is a six-person boat about 10 meters long and 1.5 meters wide. In addition to the six rowers, a Cox steers and shouts encouragement and is responsible for ensuring the crew makes land before last orders.</p>\n<p>Gigs are a common sight on the Scillies. Their names, like “Slippen”, “Bonnet” and “Nornour” pay homage to the memory of their namesakes who, in the 17th and 18th centuries, were used as transfer vessels to take Pilots out to larger ships. A Pilot was a local sailor who could navigate safely through the treacherous, rock-laden waters of the archipelago.</p>\n<p>We got chatting with a man in a pub. A misty-eyed old sea dog. He told us that it was often the case that more than one Pilot was available at any one time, and the first man to arrive would get the job. So the Gig crews took to racing, the fastest sailors would get paid, and that’s how the Gig races on the Isles started. It’s a romantic story, and I’d like to believe it’s true.</p>\n<p>The races start out at sea. The officials string a line buoys to form a start line out by Nut Rock. The crews then wait in their boats as close to the start line as they can. But woe betides any vessel that crosses the line before “go” is called. They get instantly disqualified.</p>\n<p>There are old rivalries and alliances between teams who come from all over the world. These all go out of the window once the call comes to start. Every crew for themselves. A crew of six, pulling for all their worth. From the start line, they race across the clear stretch of water to St.Mary’s harbour.</p>\n<p>From our vantage point up on the Garrison, it looks pandemonium; oars churning the sea into a raging torrent. All around the Gigs are the island’s small ferry boats filled to bursting with spectators who’ve paid for the privilege of a close-up view. Add to this the hundreds of smaller private crafts, and you wonder how they don’t smash into each other.</p>\n<p>All around us, people are screaming at the top of their lungs, as if the object of their affection could actually hear them way out at sea. I wouldn’t be surprised if they could, such is the roar of the crowd.</p>\n<p>The shouting reached fever pitch as the first of the boats rounded the quay, finish line in sight. Given how long they’ve been racing the gap between them was astonishingly close. I’m not sure how they tell, but the first Gig to cross the finish line immediately started to celebrate. They must have been knackered, but somehow they found the strength to row the final few meters to Town Beach. Here, there’s a whole army of people to help them drag the Gig up onto the beach.</p>\n<p>(figure set:gigs,class:pull-both)</p>\n<p>Wanting to drink-in more of the atmosphere and a couple of the local ales, Katie and I headed to the Mermaid. This place is incredibly claustrophobic at the best of times, with memorabilia covering every inch of every available surface. Saturday evenings are particularly busy, but this was something else. We could see punters spilling out onto the pavement as we approached. The only way to get in was to forcibly push through the sweaty throng. I imagine as we introduced ourselves into the crush, two other people were ejected from another door somewhere. This place was full.</p>\n<p>Inside the beer was flowing. People were dancing on tables. Tall tales were being told of the day’s victories. Somehow we managed to get a seat, Katie on the end of a bench, and me perched awkwardly on a window ledge. What a night! We emerged several hours later, a little drunk and horse from trying to make ourselves heard.</p>\n<p>This is one of my favourite memories of the Islands. I felt totally immersed in the culture. Caught-up in something. It was a unique experience that I don’t think we could ever recapture. In a way, I wouldn’t want to. It was perfect, trying to get it back would somehow sully it.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Taking flight</h2>\n<p><em>In 2008, I took my first trip to the islands, and my first flight on a helicopter…</em></p>\n<p>There’s always a sadness that accompanies leaving the Isles of Scilly. It started for me this first year and has never diminished on subsequent trips. At least you used to be able to offset this with the excitement of a trip on the helicopter.</p>\n<p>After waving goodbye to our bags, which would be taken to the airport for us by Island Carriers, we headed into town. Now was the chance to buy as much <abbr title=\"Isles of Scilly\">IOS</abbr> branded tat as we could lay our grubby hands on. Of course, there was the Isles of Scilly tea towel; The Isles of Scilly fridge magnet; The Isles of Scilly puffin jigsaw; And the Isles of Scilly pencil and pencil sharpener deluxe set. Our friends and family were, understandably, delighted!</p>\n<p>Maxing-out your baggage allowance on a helicopter is surprisingly straightforward. We discovered this at check-in when both of our cases — now laden with souvenirs — were well over the 15 kg limit. Luckily the airport staff were as laid-back as every other islander we’d met, and waved us through.</p>\n<p>St.Mary’s Airport is by far the smallest terminal I’ve ever flown from. It’s miniature waiting area probably never any busier than it was now. A few people milled around, while others enjoyed hot drinks from styrofoam cups.</p>\n<p>When the time came, we were called into a small side room with the other passengers for our flight. Here, we were shown a short safety film from the late 80s. Then we heard it. A helicopter coming into land. The great throb-throb-throb of its propeller blades displacing the air.</p>\n<p>One of British International’s two <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikorsky_S-61\">Sikorsky S-61</a> helicopters landed with the slightest bounce. The side door flung open, and the passengers disembarked, ducking instinctively under the rotor blades.</p>\n<p>(figure set:helicopter,class:pull-both)</p>\n<p>Then it was our turn. Our air steward lead the way out onto the runway. We ducked under the rotors too, clinging desperately to lose items of clothing. Of course, we felt like rock stars.</p>\n<p>Once belts were fastened, the door was shut behind us with a reassuringly heavy click. Not that you can hear much above the roar of the engine, which now wound up ready for take-off. We felt an increase in the side-to-side wobble, and suddenly we were moving. The helicopter’s nose tipped forward and we swept up and along the runway. It’s exhilarating! The raw power that’s required to push this massive metal tube into the air must be immense. You feel every last joule of it.</p>\n<p>The view is spectacular. Passengers lucky enough to get window seats were furiously taking as many photos as they could. It’s too loud for conversation, so we just gesticulated to each other, pointing at things we recognised.</p>\n<p>Flying at 150 <abbr title=\"Miles Per Hour\">mph</abbr>, it only takes 20 minutes from St.Marys to Penzance. All too soon the islands disappeared over the horizon, and Lands End appeared in the port side windows. Moments later we were touching down at Penzance heliport.</p>\n<p>And that was that. Suddenly we were back to reality. Cars and people everywhere. Waiting for our bags, Katie asked me what I thought. She’d been extolling the virtues of Scilly since we’d met. “I’m in love”, I said. Or something like that. That’s the problem with memories, isn’t it? It’s sometimes hard to tell them apart from dreams.</p>\n"},{"title":"Some thoughts on design leadership","tags":["leading design conference","design","design leadership","barbican","conferences"],"date":"2017-10-30T00:00:00.000Z","filename":"67","content":"<p>I spent some of last week listening to some great design leaders share their thoughts at <a href=\"https://2017.leadingdesignconf.com/\">Leading Design 2017</a>. Hosted by the fine folks from <a href=\"https://clearleft.com/\">Clearleft</a> the event is now in its second year.</p>\n<p>Before last year’s event, I was still trying to figure out what my job was, let alone how to do it well. I think my biggest fear when I took the position was that I would no longer have much to offer. Increasingly I’d be taking on less and less of the day-to-day work, and without producing designs or churning out HTML what was I? Last year’s conference helped me to figure out at least some of what I should be doing with my days:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Designing team processes, environments and culture</li>\n<li>Protecting the team from too much work</li>\n<li>Evangelising design’s role in the company’s success</li>\n</ul>\n<p>My <a href=\"http://roobottom.com/articles/56/\">notes from last year</a> are a bit of a mess. This tells me that I hadn’t really fully understood what any of these new responsibilities were. In fact, its taken the last year for me to get a handle on what any of these mean for my working life. Was I doing a shitty job in the meantime? No, well, I certainly don’t think so. I just hadn’t fully appreciated that I’d taken the step out of a production role and into a leadership role and that I was completely unprepared for what that meant.</p>\n<p>The more I learn about design leadership, the more I realise that in most of the challenges you face every day, you can usually ditch the word <em>design</em>. Leadership is its own thing, a skill you have to be taught and then refine over time. Just because you can design doesn’t automatically mean you can lead a team of designers. Not something I was quick to pick up on. My advice for new design leaders is to realise that you’re unprepared for this new challenge and to cut yourself some slack when things inevitably go wrong.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>This year, I kept a page at the front of my notebook titled “Overall thoughts” and whenever I heard common themes that struck a chord, I wrote them down:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Things go wrong for everyone, no team is perfect, not even those with 100s of designs and huge budgets</li>\n<li>No-one in your company knows what design leadership is. Spend more time with other design leaders</li>\n<li>Be the “shit umbrella” — protect your team</li>\n<li>Managing designers is hard (although, I’d change this to managing people is hard)</li>\n<li>Strategic partnership is a must. Strive to understand how you can help others in your company solve problems by understanding their point of view</li>\n<li>Take the time to understand your business, not just the role of design within it</li>\n<li>Ask obvious questions, it’s a safe bet that your not the only one who doesn’t understand</li>\n</ul>\n<p>My thoughts on design leadership continue to evolve. I don’t think I’ll ever get to a point where I can write a comprehensive list of what makes a good Head of Design. Like anything, you get better at it over time. There’s always more to be learned, and always some way to be better at your job.</p>\n<p>I do think it’s important to keep evaluating and striving to be better. And, of course, events like Leading Design give you time to step back from the coalface and formulate your thoughts.</p>\n"},{"title":"Too much tuna: The current state of design tools","date":"2017-07-31T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["design","pattern libraries","design club"],"images":[{"image":"design-club-chapter-2.jpg","caption":"Listing the tuna, members of the Design Club taking part in the workshop","set":"tuna"}],"filename":"66","content":"<p>Last week I gave a short talk at <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Design-Club/\">Design Club</a> about what my team is currently doing with pattern libraries in Sketch.</p>\n<p>It was great to hear that people had lots of questions. Its obvious that were all thinking about patterns, and particularly how Sketch symbols have enabled a new workflow.</p>\n<p>Later, we moved on to a workshop session where we mapped out our design process and made a (long) list of all the tools we were currently using day-to-day.</p>\n<p>(figure set:tuna)</p>\n<p>What was clear is that there are a <em>lot</em> of design tools out there. Sketch is ubiquitous, having quickly proved its value against creaky Adobe tools. However, there’s a whole ecosystem of other tools that are designed to fill gaps in the designers workflow.</p>\n<p>Having both a design and front-end development background I feel like I’ve seen this all before. There have been several “revolutions” in web — <abbr title=\"Cascading Style Sheets\">CSS</abbr>, Responsiveness, HTMLinJS, etc —  that all gave rise to any number of tools that promised “more time doing what you love.”</p>\n<p>Some of these tools were flash in the pan: When they didn’t find traction amongst enough developers, they died. However, they each added their voices to the shared knowledge amongst developers on <em>how</em> to develop for the web.</p>\n<p>As it is now with design tools. Sure, some of them don’t really know what they’re trying to be, but can we blame them? We don’t know what we need right now. Ultimately what matters is the thinking behind patterns not how we build them.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, if you’re designing sites for the web or apps for devices, then eventually someone with a bit of coding nounce has to translate your designs into the real deal. Regardless of whether the ultimate destination of your design is HTML, Swift or <em>whatever</em>, I’d argue that designing with patterns in mind — no matter of the size of project — helps you think more like a developer. You’ll have better conversations with your developer friends and this will lead to a better experience for your users.</p>\n<p>Patterns is a way of thinking about design, rather than a set of tools. You could just as easily apply this thinking to MS Paint. But what the tools give us is a way to explore, as a community, what works best.</p>\n<p>I personally welcome the slew of tools even if they are pretty immature right now. There’s a really smart community of designers out there that’ll direct tool makers leading us all to a brighter future.

Designers have long had the idea of designing interfaces from a kit of pre-built parts, but never really had the tools to do this effectively. Sketch is such a tool.</p>\n<p>At Firefly, we’ve recently made the transition to Sketch specifically because of the power of symbols. These have enabled us to build our pattern library in a way that helps us to do some extremely rapid prototyping and create consistent experiences for our users.</p>\n<p>Our Front-End and iOS teams already have their own pattern libraries. These are different, partly due to technical reasons, but there’s another reason we kept the patterns separate. As we continue to strive for feature parity between platforms, its obvious that there are some fundamental differences between web and iOS.  There is a <em>way</em> of doing things in iOS — interactions that users expect — that’s different from the web. Hence, web and iOS have the same features, but implemented in the way that makes the most sense to users of that platform.</p>\n<p>Our dream was to create two design pattern libraries that would contain the same elements as the web and iOS libraries. This would mean that we’d all be working from the same list of patterns, rather than adding a translation step when it came to implementation.</p>\n<h2>Structure</h2>\n<p>We studied the structure of the existing pattern libraries and created a map that included all patterns, their modifiers and states. This gave us the structure for our patterns, and a place to start from when translating programatic patterns into something that would be useable in Sketch.</p>\n<p>In simple terms, our pattern library is a number of Sketch files containing — as symbols — all the elements in the Firefly interface. We divide these into separate files, one for each platform. We’ve also broken web into web-core and one file for each of our <a href=\"http://themes.fireflylearning.com\">four core themes</a>.</p>\n<p>In each of the files, we’ve categorised our symbols into areas. This helps massively with your mental model when browsing the symbols page. This also allows us to print a visual style-guide of all our patterns.</p>\n<p>(figure set:categorising,class:poke-both)</p>\n<h2>Symbols</h2>\n<p>Sketch supports symbol nesting and overrides. This makes symbols extremely powerful. This allows you to create a pattern element by combining symbols together.</p>\n<p>However, organisation is everything. If you don’t follow a systematic approach to creating patterns, they’re extremely difficult to use in the wild. We know from experience that confusion arises about which symbols are patterns, and which are simply the building blocks of patterns. Let me explain…</p>\n<h3>Parts and Patterns</h3>\n<p>(figure set:button-anatomy,class:pull-right)</p>\n<p>A pattern is made up of either parts or other symbols. Each part is a symbol. A Button, for example, is made up of two parts <em>Background</em> and <em>Label</em>, and another pattern <em>Icon</em>. We use <a href=\"https://www.sketchapp.com/learn/documentation/symbols/organizing-symbols/\">slash notation</a> to organise parts and patterns under one namespace.</p>\n<p>(figure set:dropdown,class:poke-both)</p>\n<p>Organising our symbols this way makes it easy when using a pattern. It’s immediately obvious from the list of symbols which is a pattern that’s intended for use, and which are just the building blocks of patterns.</p>\n<h3>Using Patterns in the wild</h3>\n<p>When designing a new feature, we’ll start out with a blank sketch file. Let’s say, for example, that we wanted a very simple interface that required two buttons: OK and Cancel. OK needs to be a cancel type with a tick icon, and Cancel needs to be a default type with a cross icon.</p>\n<p>In our pattern library file, we have a page called <em>scratch</em> where we can set up a pattern ready to be copied into another file. We select the <code>Button &gt; Patterns &gt; Button with Icon Left</code> symbol from the list and drop it into our scratch page. We can then use the symbol overrides to change it’s Background, Icon and Label as required. We can also override the text.</p>\n<p>(figure set:using-a-symbol,class:poke-both)</p>\n<p>Once the pattern is set up, we can then copy this into the new document. This only copies the parts required for this instance of the pattern. So trying to change the symbol overrides in the new file won’t work until you copy over all variations of a pattern.</p>\n<h2>Tips ’n tricks</h2>\n<p>There’s a few areas where symbols are ripe for improvement. Given Bohemian’s track record for updates and bug fixes I suspect these can’t be too far off. Meantime, there’s a couple of workarounds that we’ve found particularly useful that I’d like to share.</p>\n<h3>Pin to corner</h3>\n<p>The ability to change resize behaviour in symbols is extremely useful. However, the “Pin to corner” option is somewhat limited as it doesn’t let you specify <em>which</em> corner.</p>\n<p>(figure set:pintocorner,class:pull-right)</p>\n<p>We solve this by simply grouping a transparent shape in with the layer we wish to align. This allows you pin to other corners than the one that Sketch might have automatically picked for you.</p>\n<h3>Override colours of icons</h3>\n<p>It’s annoying to have to have separate symbols for different icon colours. Especially when adding a new colour, meaning you have to create a new symbol for all the icons in the new colour.</p>\n<p>Luckily, we can use layer masks and overrides to easily add colour options. An Icon pattern is actually a grouped rectangle masked out by the icon shape. We are then able to control the icon type <em>and</em> colour from a pre-defined pallet of colours. Adding a new colour is as easy as adding a new icon mask symbol.</p>\n<p>(figure set:overridecolour,class:poke-both)</p>\n<p>Another small tip: Make your icons and masks different sizes, that way you won’t get shown all the icons and colours together in the overrides dropdown.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Sharing patterns</h2>\n<p>So far I’ve not really touched on how we’re using our pattern library across a team. An essential part of any pattern library is its use beyond a single person. When we set out to create our pattern library, we had a simple set of requirements:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Symbols should be stored in a central location that is accessible by the whole team</li>\n<li>Symbols can be linked across files, updating a symbol in any file updates it everywhere</li>\n<li>Editing clashes are handled in a nice way</li>\n<li>Symbols can be organised into categories</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>What we’re currently doing</h3>\n<p>Initially we experimented with <a href=\"https://www.invisionapp.com/craft\">Craft</a> from inVision. It’s library functionality would allow us to store symbols in a central location, share them across the team. Most excitingly of all, symbols would be linked across files, meaning we could ensure we were always using the latest version in our designs.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, when it came to handling editing clashes, Craft did less well. We lost an entire week of work due to our library file becoming corrupted. We were told that this was a known issue, and the file was unrecoverable. We decided not to entrust our entire pattern library to Craft, there was no way we could risk that happening again.</p>\n<p>We switched to using Sketch files themselves to contain our patterns. A downside to this solution was that editing clashes weren’t handled, at all. Rather, whoever saved the file last would overwrite work of anyone else. Thankfully, <a href=\"https://abstractapp.com/\">Abstract</a> came to our rescue.</p>\n<p>The team has been using Abstract for version management of Sketch files for the last few weeks, and what a difference it’s made! Once you have the git mental model in your head, Abstract’s workflow makes a lot of sense. We can now branch off the master pattern library document, make our changes, and merge back. Clashes are handled visually, giving you the choice of which symbol definition to keep.</p>\n<p>(figure set:abstarct,class:poke-both)</p>\n<p>We now have three out of four of our original requirements. We’re almost there! But what about linking symbols across files?</p>\n<h2>A native solution?</h2>\n<p>I’d argue that level of complexity represented by shared symbols in Sketch requires a native solution. Plugins, like Craft, will only ever be a poly-fill at best.</p>\n<p>Looking at the features that Bohemian have added to Sketch over the last few versions, I strongly suspect that they’re already planning shared symbols. It’s a natural fit for them, they already have the cloud infrastructure from Sketch Cloud and with their new open JSON formatted files, it seems like this might be the next logical step.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Are you looking for a new design challenge in London?

She had a brilliant time! Here’s some of the things we liked:</p>\n<h2>Flying</h2>\n<p>In contrast to the last time we flew with <em>Roo</em>, this time we’d deliberately not booked flights which demanded us be at the airport at some ungodly hour.

Being early in the season meant we picked up a bargain, and we’re able to stay in a massive country villa with amazing views. <em>Roo</em> especially loved the large fenced gardens, meaning she could tear around outside in relative safety. Being independent is increasingly important to her at the moment, so this was great.</p>\n<p>(figure set:house)</p>\n<h2>Pisa</h2>\n<p>Although she quite enjoyed having her picture taken holding up the leaning tower, Pisa isn’t the most relaxing place to visit with a small child. We spent a few hours here, but any more would’ve pushed <em>Roo</em> over the edge and into the canyon of tantrum.</p>\n<p>(figure set:leaningtower)</p>\n<p>One thing we <em>did</em> really like here was the Botanical Gardens. These we’re uncrowded and gave <em>Roo</em> ample room to run around amongst the beautiful flowers. If you find yourself in Pisa with a small child, seek them out. For only €4 an adult, they’re the perfect antidote to the crowds in the Square of Miracles.</p>\n<p>(figure set:gardens)</p>\n<h2>Lucca</h2>\n<p>Lucca is a fabulous place. We spent a couple of different days here, the first time just for a few hours to grab lunch and explore until the inevitable tiredness-time-bomb went off and a screaming child forced us home for tea.</p>\n<p>The second time, while my mum and dad went off to Florence, Katie, <em>Roo</em> and I spent a whole day here. We hired a side-by-side bicycle, which she <em>loved</em>, shouting “ciao” at passers-by.</p>\n<p>(figure set:bike)</p>\n<p>We had more pizza outside at a <a href=\"http://www.ristorantesancolombanolucca.it/en/\">lovely restaurant</a> where the staff we’re amazing with <em>Roo</em>, bringing her food out extremely quickly. This is mission critical, as I’m sure anyone with a hungry toddler in a public place will know.</p>\n<p>(figure set:lunch)</p>\n<p>After lunch, with <em>Roo</em> asleep in the push-chair, we explored the tiny winding streets. It was idilic in the afternoon sun. Katie went off to shop, and I took the opportunity to climb the recently restored <em>Torre Delle Ore</em>. The effort of climbing the 470 steps was rewarded at the top with an amazing view of the whole city and surrounding hills.</p>\n<p>(figure set:tower)</p>\n<p><em>Roo</em> woke up on the way back to the car, just as we were passing the merry go round. “I go on that?” she said.

It had none of the crowds of Pisa, and felt an altogether more chilled out place.</p>\n<h2>In summary</h2>\n<p>We really hit the jackpot with both the location and weather for our week in northern Tuscany. There’s lot to enjoy for little people in this region if you’re prepared to miss out on some of the more famous places, and go where the crowds aren’t.

Thrashing out ideas with paper and pen is a great way of capturing early ideas quickly with the minimum of fuss. Together with user research, sketching is among the first steps we take whenever we’re designing a new feature.</p>\n<p>We’re also constantly refining our processes, always on the lookout for more efficient ways to build better software that allow our users to perform the tasks they find most useful.</p>\n<p>We’ve recently started using some ideas from a methodology called <strong>Design Sprints</strong>. Although its still early days, I wanted to share our experience of (what I’m calling) Firefly-flavoured Design Sprints.</p>\n<p>(figure set:squad)</p>\n<h2>What is a design sprint?</h2>\n<p>The design sprint was developed by Jake Knapp from <a href=\"http://www.gv.com/sprint/\">Google Ventures</a>. In its full form, its a five day process for answering business questions through design. Its a way to fail early meaning you, <em>theoretically</em>, deliver something that works first time.</p>\n<p>Implicit in the process is the requirement to gather opinions from all areas of the business, not just the design team. Typically you might involve those with customer contact, for example the support or client-experience teams. You may also invite an expert from finance and marketing as well as members from the tech and design teams.</p>\n<p>A plan for the week might look like this:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr><th>Day</th><th>Outline</th></tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td>Monday</td><td>Understanding the challenge and decide what problem you’re trying to solve</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Tuesday</td><td>A number of different sketching activities to fully explore potential solutions</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Wednesday</td><td>The whole team presents and votes on solutions from Tuesday.</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Thursday</td><td>Creating a prototype of a chosen solution.</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Friday</td><td>Testing your prototype with real users and gathering feedback.</td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>What’s the benefit for Firefly?</h2>\n<p>We’ve been getting excited about Design Sprints for a while. The mantra of “fail early” is especially useful as it helps us to stay agile in a fast-paced market place.</p>\n<p>We’ve always listened closely to what teachers, students and parents want, but understanding exactly what they’ll find genuinely useful is rather more difficult.</p>\n<p>A process like Design Sprints helps us get our ideas in-front of customers at the earliest possible opportunity, and find out if what we <em>think</em> they want is actually useful, without going through the long process of design, build and QA first.</p>\n<h2>Our experience</h2>\n<p>We already had a very well defined problem, namely how to give schools greater flexibility in their Firefly navigation. In the sprint we’d set out to design both the updated navigation and the administration interface that would allow site administrators to customise the menu.</p>\n<p>I ran the day, as the “facilitator”. Viviana, our product manager, was the “decider”. The Communications squad (a cross-discipline team who would be building the feature) were our sketching team.</p>\n<p>We used a number of the activities from the Design Sprints book, together with a mix of activities from elsewhere that we thought would enable us to solve this problem in a day.</p>\n<h3>Jobs to be done</h3>\n<p>Before the sprint, Viv created a list of <strong>jobs to be done</strong>. Based directly from feedback, these are a way to think about tasks that users want to achieve. They’re written in a way so as the focus is on the task rather than a particular technology or solution, an example of this might be:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When organising the school’s Firefly pages, I want to be able to divide pages into highly visible sections, so I can make it easier to find content that is relevant for students, parents and teachers and show off the content we have.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Sketching</h3>\n<p>We went through a number of sketching exercises, first creating quick low fidelity sketches to flesh-out some early ideas. Then we moved on to creating more detailed sketches that detailed a whole user journey.</p>\n<p>(figure set:sketching)</p>\n<h3>Arriving at a solution</h3>\n<p>After each of the team had taken it in turns to present their sketch, we moved onto a round of <strong>heat mapping</strong>. Everyone was given a set of 10 sticky dots and we’re told to stick one or two next to features they particularly liked from the sketches. In this way, standout features were highlighted by clusters of dots.</p>\n<p>(figure set:voting)</p>\n<p>Viv then lead a round of Q&amp;A where we’d discuss the standout features. As the decider, she then made the call on which features would progress to design stage. I noted these down as a set of requirements.</p>\n<p>Finally, we created a final set of sketches as a team (with one person designated as the “scribe”) that combined all the features into a coherent user journey.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>This type of small, well-defined problem <em>is</em> solvable in a day. What we didn’t do is square the circle, i.e., test our solution with users. That’s a definite problem. We plan on creating interactive prototypes during the design stage which we’ll test with teachers.</p>\n<p>I predict this won’t turn-up too many surprises as we’ve not deviated too far from an established pattern. But this is definitely worth thinking about earlier for more complex problems or brand-new features.</p>\n<p>On a practical level we were also able to refine the “short-sprint” process for the next time: Chopping out the bits that didn’t yield anything useful and providing better explanations around the bits that confused people.</p>\n<p>We would’ve also liked to invite some guest experts from other areas of the business, we’ll definitely do this next time.</p>\n<h2>Where next?</h2>\n<p>Finding a balance between the full methodology as set out in the book, and a process we can use many times in quick succession is tricky. Cherry-picking <em>is</em> something the book suggests: You can remove day five, and do testing as a separate process without the need for the whole team. However, we deconstructed the sprint to its bare-bones, and I’m not convinced we didn’t loose… <em>something</em>.</p>\n<p>But, Firefly-flavoured Design Sprints are definitely here to stay. We’ve already booked-in longer sprints to help us solve slightly bigger problems, and allow us to include more of the methodology. We’ll refine them over time, cherry-picking the bits that work best for us.</p>\n<p>The culture of fail-early is one that we’re committed to. At the heart of this is getting features into the hands of clients as early as possible, listening to their feedback, and quickly delivering the next iteration. Design Sprints are just one way of doing this.</p>\n"},{"title":"The road to Firefly 6, part 2","date":"2017-01-23T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["Firefly","design"],"images":[{"image":"anna-and-danielle.jpg","caption":"Anna and Danielle discuss the relative merits of button patterns in the old Firefly office, October 2015","set":"anna"},{"image":"markbook.jpg","caption":"The Firefly Markbook, showing some example data from our training class.","set":"markbook"}],"filename":"60","content":"<p>This is part two of a two part article all about building Firefly 6 and the lessons we learned along the way.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"/articles/59\">part one</a> we took whistle stop tour of the year-and-a-half it took to design and build Firefly 6.

In October we were joined for a few days by Anna Debenham who literally wrote the book on <a href=\"http://www.maban.co.uk/projects/front-end-style-guides/\">front-end style guides</a> to help us catalogue Firefly’s user interface.</p>\n<p>(figure set:anna)</p>\n<p>We used this to build a “single source of truth” library of interface elements. This means that Firefly is now essentially built from a kit of parts. If we need a button, we can just call one in from the library. Even better, if we find a bug with the button, we can fix it once, and its fixed everywhere. Much faster and a lot more robust.</p>\n<p>I also have to mention <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniellehuntrods/\">Danielle Huntrods</a>, a contractor who worked with us for almost a year, during which she built the majority of the of the pattern library. It was her brilliance that gave us such a solid foundation for the future.</p>\n<p>We plan (at some point) to release a publicly accessible version of the pattern library. This is part of our ongoing commitment to openness and giving back to the web community. Hopefully others will find what we’ve done useful.</p>\n<h2>We flattened the cascade</h2>\n<p>Cascading Style Sheets, or CSS, is the language that allows us to define the visual appearance of web pages. Firefly uses quite a lot of it.</p>\n<p>CSS uses something called a “Cascade”, meaning that elements can inherit their style from other elements that use the same HTML. For example:</p>\n<pre><code>button {\n    background-color: blue;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Means all <code>button</code> elements on the page would have a blue background.</p>\n<p>However if you wanted to make one red, you can give it a name, and use that name in the CSS to override the background colour to red. Useful and straightforward enough.</p>\n<p>However, The problem with this comes when you have thousands of elements. Sometimes, when you style one element, because of the way CSS cascades, you inadvertently style another element you didn’t mean to.</p>\n<p>We solve this at Firefly by using a way of writing CSS called BEM, or Block Element Modifier. This allows us to effectively remove the cascade by using a naming system that guarantees that  you only ever style the specific element you meant to.</p>\n<p>This is great for us at Firefly, as it means we ship far less styling bugs. And it makes it easy for us to fix those bugs that do slip through, knowing that we’re not going to accidentally  cause more bugs elsewhere.</p>\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/\">read more about BEM here</a>, on the excellent CSS Tricks website.</p>\n<h2>We became more Reactive</h2>\n<p>Firefly makes heavy use of the other great language of the web: Javascript. This is the technology that allows us to manipulate the interface in real-time, without having to reload the page every time you take any action within Firefly.</p>\n<p>To help us write better Javascript, we’ve stared using a library called <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/react/\">React</a>. React was developed by Facebook to solve some of the challenges they were facing when building their website.</p>\n<p>To understand why this is good for Firefly, lets look at a practical example of a feature we introduced in Firefly 5: The Markbook.</p>\n<p>The Markbook is a highly interactive screen with lots of different states. We use Javascript to manage these states. However, this is where things get complicated very quickly. The developer must remember to update <em>all</em> the states when the user interacts with <em>any</em> of the states.</p>\n<p>For example, opening one popup will need to close any others. As you add more and more states, this compounds the problem. This is the source of many bugs, as developers can’t keep all these things in their heads all at once.</p>\n<p>(figure set:markbook)</p>\n<p>React manages states for you, by keeping its own internal copy of the page’s HTML, (what’s known as the Document Object Model, or DOM). It continually compares <em>its</em> model  to the real DOM that’s shown to the user, and updates it on the fly.</p>\n<p>In this way, things like closing one popup when another is opening can be controlled by one simple rule, and React handles the rest. This is leads to less bugs and happier users.</p>\n<p>We make use of React in the new Task Details screen, where teachers can mark student’s work in a variety of ways. This screen has hundreds of different states, all managed reliably by React.</p>\n<h2>We simplified our themes offering</h2>\n<p>This was perhaps the most controversial changes we made with made in Firefly 6. We did this to improve the user experience of the majority of users in Firefly, but quite understandably some schools were disgruntled when they discovered that we were retiring Columnist and Angular. We were also removed support for a number of custom themes we’d built for some of our long-standing clients.</p>\n<h3>Fewer bugs</h3>\n<p>Themes have always been the source of front-end bugs within Firefly. Each theme has its own HTML with which it “wraps” standard Firefly elements (like resource page content, or the Markbook for example). It also has its own CSS with which it will restyle the standard Firefly elements.</p>\n<p>This means that when we release new feature or updates existing ones, we also have to update the themes. The more themes, the more updates we have to do. Obviously, this model doesn’t scale well. So we’ve reduced the number of themes we offer to ensure that when we release updates, we can ensure that all our schools have a great experience.</p>\n<h3>Theme Variables</h3>\n<p>What about theme customisation? Many schools want to inject their personality into the tools they use every day. In Firefly 5 we introduced <strong>Theme Variables</strong> to do just this. We improved them in Firefly 6 (more about that later), but its worth covering the basics:</p>\n<p>Firefly uses a CSS pre-processor called <em><a href=\"http://lesscss.org/\">Less</a></em>. This allows us to store colours as variables, and manipulate them programatically. For example, Melody has a variable called <code>@background-colour</code>, thats used in different places throughout the interface. <em>Less</em> allows you to use an array of <a href=\"http://lesscss.org/functions/#color-operations\">colour operation functions</a> to do things like darken or lighten colours. This is particularly useful for creating a harmonious colour scheme.</p>\n<p>We also use <em>Less</em> to check the relative contrast between two colours. For example, lets say we have a box, styled like this:</p>\n<pre><code>.box {\n    background-colour: @background-colour;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>We’d want to check that any text that’s put inside that box is legible. We can do this with <em>Less</em> by checking the contrast of two alternative colours <em>against</em> a background colour, and using the one which is most legible, like so:</p>\n<pre><code>.box {\n    background-colour: @background-colour;\n    color: contrast(@background-colour, black, white);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>All of which means that, per school, we can override these core variables with school colours, and be assured that the interface will still look great, and all text will be legible.</p>\n<h3>Better theme options</h3>\n<p>We’ve done a lot of work in Firefly 6 to improve and streamline the Theme Variables. Each theme now only requires a small set of colours. Every other colour used within the interface is based-off this core set.</p>\n<p>We’ve also removed a number of theme options that weren’t really adding much value for schools. For instance, lots of schools told us that they didn’t really care about things like background patterns, or changing fonts. We now use smart defaults instead.</p>\n<p>We’ve paved the way to style more of the interface based-off the schools’ colour choices in the future, all in a way that will work with feature updates we make.</p>\n<h2>Wrapping up</h2>\n<p>I hope you’ve found these couple of articles interesting. We like to be as open as possible about the way we build software. Hopefully this has given you an insight into the internal workings here at Firefly, and the things we’ve done to ensure we’re delivering the absolute best product possible.</p>\n"},{"title":"The road to Firefly 6, part 1","date":"2017-01-16T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["Firefly","design"],"images":[{"image":"big-red-button.jpg","caption":"Robin, Viv and I gather around the beautifully designed button to activate Firefly 6 in our offices in Hammersmith, 12th December 2016","set":"A"},{"image":"me-user-testing.jpg","caption":"Me doing some user testing at the Firefly Learning Conference in Birmingham, November 2016","set":"testing"},{"image":"sketching.jpg","caption":"An early sketch from a sketching workshop we ran at  the Firefly offices","set":"testing"},{"image":"team-firefly.jpg","caption":"Almost all of Team Firefly at the Firefly Learning Conference in Birmingham, 15th November 2016","set":"team"},{"image":"office-1.jpg","caption":"Firefly’s new offices at the Aircraft Factory, Hammersmith.","set":"office"},{"image":"office-2.jpg","caption":"Joe’s old Raleigh Firefly bike in pride of place at the Firefly offices in Hammersmith, October 2016","set":"office"}],"filename":"59","content":"<p>Recently, Robin, Viv and I had the honour of pushing the (literal) big red button that would enable our clients to upgrade to Firefly 6. Champaign corks were popped and pizza was enjoyed by the whole team before we, very quickly, very diligently, returned to work.</p>\n<p>(figure set:A)</p>\n<p>Now seems like a good point to pause, and look back on the past eighteen months and the changes we made to our team, technology and working practices that enabled us to release the biggest step-change in Firefly to date.</p>\n<p>I’ve broken this article into two parts: This first part starts with journey in time from the deep dark past of April 2015 right up to the present day. We learned a lot about <em>how</em> to build great software in this time, so I’ll talk about that at the end.</p>\n<p>In part two (spoiler alert) I’ll talk about the changes we made to our technology stack and our design and front-end development teams.</p>\n<h2>Spring/Summer 2015</h2>\n<p>Back in April 2015 we knew <em>roughly</em> what teachers, students and parents wanted from the next version of Firefly. However, there was still lots of work to do to refine our ideas into a definite, focused list of features that would work for everyone.</p>\n<p>As Head of Product, Viv ran a number of discovery workshops with teachers, students and parents from a large number of our schools. Armed with this research, our UX team was able to start sketching solutions from which we could create interactive product mock-ups. These were then tested with more users, refined, and tested again.</p>\n<p>(figure set:testing)</p>\n<p>We didn’t just limit this discovery phase to the start of the project, we continued to conduct user research at every stage. We’re lucky that our clients don’t mind acting as guinea pigs and let us test all our crazy new ideas on them. We also engaged an agency to connect with non-client teachers, students and parents, to ensure that the new features would work for everyone, not just those used to Firefly already.</p>\n<h2>Autumn/Winter 2015</h2>\n<p>While research and design were progressing nicely, thoughts turned to a busy conference season. With the Firefly Learning Conference just around the corner and Bett looming, we knew we needed something more tangible than interactive mock-ups to show people.</p>\n<p>Bett, in particular, would be the first time clients and prospects alike could get hands-on with the new Firefly. We had to build a demo version of Firefly that would work well enough to give prospective clients a taste of what was to come in Firefly 6, that would also be robust enough to work with the WiFi in the ExCel centre.</p>\n<p>In a sterling effort by all involved, we cut a demo-ready version of Firefly less than 24 hours before the start of the show. Despite there being a few bits of hidden sticky-tape and string holding everything together, we had an amazingly successful Bett. The demo stood up to anyting our stand visitors threw at it, and I think its fair to say that everyone was suitably wowed.</p>\n<h2>Spring/Summer 2016</h2>\n<p>At the Firefly Learning Conference in November we’d confidently told our clients that they could expect Firefly 6 in the summer term. By the spring it was apparent that we couldn’t meet this deadline and release a version of Firefly that was of sufficient quality. So we took the difficult decision to delay the release to the next logical point where schools would have a chance to install it in-between terms: Christmas.</p>\n<p>In the summer we we’re able to release the new navigation, and because it was now in the hands of schools quickly iterate it based on feedback from a large group of users. As with all changes, it was met with a mixed reception, but the vast majority of users loved the changes we’d made.</p>\n<h2>Autumn/Winter 2016</h2>\n<p>We were now nearing the end of our development phase. A significant portion of both the web app and native iOS and Android apps had now been completed. We were on target for our completion date of 28th November, which would give us 2 weeks to do final testing before launch on 12th December.</p>\n<p>Building software is hard; Building great software is very hard. So it was understandable that the final few weeks before our production deadline was filled with late nights and many take-outs in the office.</p>\n<p>It is a testament to the diligent work of everyone involved that we brought this incredible new version in on time. Not just the team who built the software, but also the support, client experience, sales and marketing teams. They’re all responsible in equal part for Firefly 6.</p>\n<p>(figure set:team,class:span-both)</p>\n<h2>Please release me, let me go</h2>\n<p>Even the most old school software companies release their software more often than every 18 months, so why did we take a year-and-a-half to release Firefly 6?</p>\n<p>Well, the reality is that we were releasing, every two weeks in fact. We shipped <strong>35</strong> versions from <code>5.2.1</code> in April 2015 to <code>6.0.1</code> on 12th December 2016. These releases included a large number of bug fixes, and lots of new features and tweaks to existing features.</p>\n<p>So why was 6 such a big release? Well, this was such a step change that there were several Epics that wouldn’t make sense in isolation. For example, the new <em>Set A Task</em> flow allows teachers to create rich tasks with far more flexibility than tasks they could create in Firefly 5. Releasing this without any ability for students to respond to these tasks, or teachers then to mark the response was simply unfeasible.</p>\n<h2>Things we learned and changes we made</h2>\n<p>We’ve certainly have learned a thing or two along the way, not least that we need more development resource, but having just landing the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/15/firefly-takes-5-6m-series-a-for-its-learning-support-platform-for-schools/\">largest Series A investment</a> in Education Technology in the UK, we’re certainly now in a position to do that.</p>\n<p>It wouldn’t have been possible to build such complex software with a relatively small team without some smart ways of working. Over the last year-and-a-half we’ve made some big changes to the way we work, these help us work faster and release less bugs.</p>\n<h3>We established Epics, Squads and Guilds</h3>\n<p>We spilt sets of features up into logic chunks. These, we call <strong>Epics</strong>. An Epic is a set of features that makes sense end-to-end. For example, the new task setting flow was a single Epic. This included all the backend logic, and user interface elements for teachers, parents and students.</p>\n<p>Each Epic is owned by team called a <strong>Squad</strong>. A Squad is a self contained unit of UX’ers, Designers, Developers and a manager. Everyone who’s needed to research, design, build, refine and manage workflow for that one Epic.</p>\n<p>There are parts of the product that are relevant to more than one Squad. For example, the Pattern Library is used by all squads working on the Firefly web interface. To manage changes and updates to these areas we have <strong>Guilds</strong>. Typically a Guild will contain a representative from each Squad, and meet on an ad-hoc basis when changes are needed.</p>\n<h3>We moved</h3>\n<p>It would be remiss of me not to mention our new office. In October we moved from Lyric Square to the Aircraft Factory, in Hammersmith. We now have an amazing space that feels far more attuned to building brilliant software. We even have Joe’s old Raleigh Firefly bike (the inspiration for the name) in pride of place above his desk.</p>\n<p>(figure set:office)</p>\n<h3>We established the Nine Rules</h3>\n<p>I think what we’ve learned can be distilled into a set of principles that we’ve refined throughout this project. These are <strong>Firefly’s Nine Rules:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Frequent tasks should be easy and occasional tasks achievable</strong>. Teachers are incredibly busy, don’t give them a vast array of options.</li>\n<li><strong>Use smart defaults.</strong> We make good choices, so users don’t have to.</li>\n<li><strong>Don’t make me think.</strong> Make the next action obvious and unambiguous. Reduce unnecessary choices.</li>\n<li><strong>Beautiful by default.</strong> Teachers want to be proud of the things they create, so make this easy for them,</li>\n<li><strong>Optimise.</strong> Firefly should be fast.</li>\n<li><strong>Do less.</strong> Firefly should do a core set of things extremely well.</li>\n<li><strong>Design for teaching, not content management.</strong> Firefly isn’t a content management system, its a learning tool.</li>\n<li><strong>Right feature at the right moment.</strong> Too many options are confusing, be smart about when we expose a new feature.</li>\n<li><strong>Firefly isn’t just used in school</strong> Users should be able to achieve their task, no matter their location.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Where next?</h3>\n<p>Its an exciting time for Firefly. We’re expanding our team, and we’re brimming with ideas for the future. We’re working closely with a wide array of our clients to shape the next iteration of Firefly. There won’t be a large release for a while, but that’s exciting in itself, it means we’re going to work on smaller features that we can get into your hands quicker. I, for one, can’t wait to see what the next eighteen months brings.</p>\n"}],"uri":"page-2"},{"items":[{"title":"I made some Christmas cards","date":"2016-12-14T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["drawing"],"images":[{"image":"christmas-cards-2016.jpg","caption":"Some Christmas cards, wot I made","set":"cards"}],"filename":"58","content":"<p>(figure set:cards,class:pull-both)</p>\n<p>I tried my hand at watercolour and created some Christmas cards.

It was great! It had a gated pool, and all the toys the child could ever want. It was also close to beaches, restaurants and interesting places to visit.</p>\n<p>The weather was a bit of a mixed bag, we had a few nice days, but if you like it hot (Like I do) then mid-October isn’t really the time to visit Portugal. It certainly wasn’t warm enough to heat the solar-powered pool heater. I went in a few times, but it was too cold for Katie and <em>Roo</em>.</p>\n<h2>Striking a balance</h2>\n<p>Every now and again I have a moment where it dawns on me that we have a child now, and our lives will never be the same again. Our first family holiday was one of those moments. Gone were the late night meals-out and morning lay-ins of holidays gone by. We could no longer plan days out that consisted purely of thing that Katie and I wanted to do. We had a little head to consider.</p>\n<h2>Things we liked</h2>\n<p>I think we managed to strike a balance, and found activities that we all enjoyed. <em>Roo</em> (for the most part) was happy to go with the flow, and enjoyed exploring new places.</p>\n<p>Here’s some of the things we liked in and around Caldas da Rainha.</p>\n<h3>Food</h3>\n<p>The Portuguese all seemed to love children, so made eating out at lunch extremely easy. There were excellent restaurants almost  everywhere we went, but a personal favourite was the vegetarian restaurant <a href=\"http://maratona.tv/\">Maratona</a> in the centre of Caldas. They were brilliant with <em>Roo</em>, rushing through an order of chips to prevent the inevitable mealtime meltdown.</p>\n<p>(figure set:maratona)</p>\n<h3>Exploring</h3>\n<p>We were delighted to find that <em>Roo</em> didn’t mind mooching around villages and towns. She was fascinated by the shops full of (mainly tile-based) gifts. As long as she was fed and could enjoy the occasional ice cream she was happy.</p>\n<p>The monastery at Albobaça was a particular favourite, with it’s large stone rooms. She loved hearing her footsteps and voice echoing down the corridors, <em>“echo, Mummy!”</em></p>\n<p>(figure set:monastery,class:span-both)</p>\n<p>We also really liked \u000fÓbidos, a fortified city that dates back to the 13th century. She loved the shops, castle and ice cream. We loved exploring the castle walls, the wonderful weather and the local cherry liqueur that you drink from a chocolate cup.</p>\n<h3>Lisbon Oceanarium</h3>\n<p>She <em>loved</em> the Oceanarium in Lisbon. We did have to queue a little for tickets (top tip: book online before you go) but the efficient staff meant our wait was fairly short.</p>\n<p>I would love to know what she was thinking as she stared up at the double-floor height tank full, packed to the <em>gills</em> with all kind of fish. Its difficult to know what goes through that little head, but she chatted about <em>“fsh”</em> all the way back to the Villa.</p>\n<p>(figure set:oceanarium)</p>\n<h3>Buddha Eden</h3>\n<p>The Buddha Eden in Bombarral is an amazing place. Set in 30 acres of beautiful gardens are hundreds of sculptures from all over Asia. <em>Roo</em> loved the wide open spaces and all the huge sculptures. There’s also some well times cafés where we were able to refuel while <em>Roo</em> had a sleep in her push-chair.</p>\n<p>(figure set:buddha)</p>\n<h3>Beaches, parks and gardens</h3>\n<p>Besides all the things we paid money for, there were plenty of free things that we enjoyed too. There is a beautiful park in Caldas that was a big hit with <em>Roo</em>, full of amazing green spaces, a lovely play-park and a couple of nice cafés.</p>\n<p>There’s also some really great beaches in this area, which were deserted when we visited, it being so late in the year. The sea was freezing, but that didn’t stop <em>Roo</em> enjoying a paddle.</p>\n<p>(figure set:park)</p>\n<h2>Things we didn’t like as much</h2>\n<p>The flight home was a bit rubbish. We’d stayed in a hotel at the airport the night before, but hadn’t really thought through the night sharing a room with <em>Roo</em>. So, between a disturbed night in a strange room and the 4:30am start to get our early flight its fair to say that <em>Roo</em> wasn’t in the best of moods.</p>\n<p>Halfway home, in order to placate our struggling child, Katie had taken her on a walk down the isle to visit the cabin crew. While there she decided to vomit over the side of the plane and several unsuspecting passengers. Tiredness had gotten the better of her.</p>\n<h2>In summary</h2>\n<p>We had a brilliant time in Portugal, we’d thoroughly recommend it as a holiday destination with a small child. It was different, for sure, but I think we made it work, and made some more happy memories with the <em>Roo</em>.</p>\n"},{"title":"Common threads from Leading Design Conference 2016","date":"2016-10-26T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["design","conferences"],"filename":"56","content":"<p>I’ve just spent three days at the Barbican enjoying the inaugural Leading Design Conference. Having being promoted the role of Head of Design fairly recently, I found the vast majority of the talks and both workshops extremely poignant.</p>\n<p>This was also the sense I got from my fellow attendees. Chatting with people over lunch, or a beer later on, I was struck by just how many “Yeah, me too!” moments we had. It turns out that leading design is hard, but I’m reassured to know that people have the same problems as me.</p>\n<p>I was further reassured at the common themes that emerged over the event. It means we’re all on similar pages (or, at least we’re all reading the same book), and in an attempt to sift through those bits of knowledge that really spoke to me, here’s my top (sometimes badly paraphrased) common threads from the last three days. This is far-from all the messages that spoke to me, but this is the stuff that will have most immediate impact on my work:</p>\n<h2>Designing design</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://scottberkun.com/\">Scott Berkun</a>’s talk <em>Design vs. The World</em> started the conference on the right note with a big picture view of what it means to do design in the real world, and how it isn’t just pushing pixels around a screen. It got me thinking about my role, and how its increasingly solving problems that aren’t related to UI design, or writing CSS.</p>\n<p>Later, during the Q&amp;A session with <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/aboutthebbc/insidethebbc/managementstructure/biographies/whitney_julia/\">Julia Whitney</a> (BBC), <a href=\"http://www.dannyhearn.me/\">Danny Hearn</a> and <a href=\"https://www.markboulton.co.uk/\">Mark Boulton</a> (Monotype), it was said (with perhaps a hint of lamentation) that we’re no longer doing design at the coal-face, rather it’s our job to design the design experience: The environments and culture in which our teams works, and the processes they lean-on to get their work done.</p>\n<p>This really struck a chord with me.</p>\n<h2>Resistance is futile</h2>\n<p>Someone (I’m sorry I can’t remember who) included a slide of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borg_(Star_Trek)\">Locutus of Borg</a>, simultaneously making the point about assimilating into other team’s cultures, and scoring points with me for a Star Trek reference.</p>\n<p>In her talk <em>New on the Job: Your First 90 Days in a Design Leadership Role</em> <a href=\"http://pnts.us/\">Andrea Mignolo</a> talked about the “layer cake”, a delicious way to visualise the hierarchy in your company. She argued that you had to design the experience for each layer, to talk about design in the language of your audience.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/@ccourage\">Catherine Courage</a> said “Strive for shared empathy”, the points in the middle where you can meet and talk design in a way thats understandable by even the most numbers-driven business development manager.</p>\n<p>In both her talk and brilliant workshop <a href=\"http://www.practicallyux.com/\">Gail Swanson</a> taught us about presenting to decision makers. We used mapping techniques to better understand the drivers for those people from whom we seek approval. This is definitely a technique I’ll try at Firefly, to be able to frame an argument in a way that already fits in with the pressures and  priorities of others is incredibly powerful.</p>\n<h2>Dark matter</h2>\n<p>How do we quantify the value of design? Its difficult to ask quantitative questions when you’re dealing with solving problems on an emotional level. How would you measure a target like “Users feel 9% more engaged this quarter”? We don’t have the tools to measure qualitative data like this. And yet, this is the stuff that really adds value.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://nathan.com/\">Nathan Shedroff</a>’s talk <em>Using the Waveline: Mapping Premium Value to the User Journey (a new tool for planning deeper customer experiences)</em> detailed how to start to measure the emotional impact over time that your product or service has, and how this can be designed for maximum empathy.</p>\n<p>If you’re at all involved in designing anything for anyone (I would argue that’s everyone), then I’d recommend further reading into Nathan’s Waveline theories. It’s certainly something I’ll investigate further.</p>\n<h2>A quick note on the conference itself</h2>\n<p>Leading Design was perhaps the most useful, insightful and timely conference I’ve ever attended. Huge thanks to <a href=\"http://clearleft.com/is/andy-budd\">Andy Budd</a> et al for doing such a great job, and spotting the need for this event. You asked if we wanted another in 2017, its a resounding “yes” from me.</p>\n<p>The last thing I want to mention was the venue. I jumped a the chance for a tour of the Barbican during the lunch break the second day. If you’re a fan of brutalist architecture then this site is must-see. It was the perfect venue for a fantastic three days of conference.</p>\n"},{"title":"We need to talk about Europe","date":"2016-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["politics"],"images":[{"image":"we-need-to-talk-about-europe.jpg","caption":"A badly drawn EU flag, in tatters","set":"default"}],"filename":"55","content":"<p>Like many of my friends, I was shocked by the results of last weeks referendum about Britain’s future in Europe.

No surprises there. My wife Katie, and our daughter, were away for a couple of nights and I’d decided to get an early night without the possibility of being woken by a little voice in the night. When my alarm woke me at six-thirty, I immediately checked my phone. I couldn’t believe it. How could this have happened?</p>\n<p>But why should I feel so angry, when only a few weeks ago I couldn’t make up my mind which way to vote? When the referendum was first announced, I’d just assumed I’d vote to remain. I suppose I’m of that generation that doesn’t have a concept of the empire, or Britain being great. I’ve lived all my life in a country who’s best days were supposedly behind it. So being part of Europe, being part of that culture, history and having hope for a united future is incredibly attractive.</p>\n<p>But then I listened to the arguments to leave: That we’d be better off by electing our own law-makers; That we’d save £350million a week; That the European Union is on the verge of collapse anyway, and I started to doubt my convictions.</p>\n<p>It was only when I started to <em>really</em> think about these claims, and read a little deeper into them did I decide that my gut instincts were right: The EU may be far from perfect, but if these were the sort of lies the leave campaign had to employ in order to persuade me, then, on balance, we’d be better off remaining. In other ways too, staying part of Europe, having a seat at the negotiating table, felt like the better choice to me. I wanted our future to be open, not closed off.</p>\n<h2>Brexit fallout</h2>\n<p>The Brexit fallout was swift. Our policy makers quickly fell into old patterns of in-party fighting and back-stabbing. No one has yet really set out a plan for what we do next beyond a few platitudes designed to reassure, but ultimately saying nothing. I have a horrible feeling that both main parties haven’t a clue what to do next. Even worse still, there seems to be something rotten at the heart of the Conservative party that is yet to come to light. What is clear, though, is that the old party divisions don’t work any more.</p>\n<p>The country is divided: “We are the 48%” chant those marching on London in protest at what was ultimately a fair democratic result. “Cry babies” comes the reply from the leave camp. It’s a mess. Darkest of all is the actions of a few who think this result means that half the country just gave them carte blanche to air their bullshit racist rhetoric.</p>\n<p>Beyond our borders, it seems that exiting the EU will have little to no effect on migrants entering Britain. And why would it? We’re completely reliant on foreign works to shore-up our essential services. What our exit does is send the wrong message of &quot;You’re not welcome here&quot;. It remains to be seen how this will play out, but we may have just alienated a large group of people we rely upon every day.</p>\n<h2>Liar, liar</h2>\n<p>Perhaps the hardest pill for those on both sides of the debate was the way in which our exit was won. It’s abundantly clear that many politicians aren’t above telling bold-faced lies in order to secure a result.</p>\n<p>This, for me, is the most unbelievable fact of UK politics. How can it be right for those we’re supposed to trust with governing our lives to openly lie to us? Perhaps I’m misunderstanding the situation, but this seems completely crazy.</p>\n<h2>Where now?</h2>\n<p>This whole sorry affair has highlighted some home truths: I’ve never been particularly interested in politics. I never know the policies of those standing in local elections, I just vote based on some loose affiliation with the party my parents support. This is, admittedly, totally unacceptable.</p>\n<p>Talking with friends, I was not surprised that many of them feel the same way. I don’t think it’s totally our fault though. The main parties in this country often say roughly the same things. It seems they have old policies that seek to fulfil the goals of the party 30 years ago, but are irrelevant today. No wonder its hard to choose between them.</p>\n<p>For my part, and for many friends, Brexit came as a shock. I’m hoping we can use it for positive change in the way we approach those that would seek public office — and our role in electing them. I’m striving to become more informed, and with information comes power to make the right choices for a better future for Britain.</p>\n"},{"date":"2015-11-12T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Firefly Learning Conference 2015","images":[{"image":"conference-2015-cover.jpg","caption":"Simon, at the Firefly Learning Conference 2015"},{"image":"conference-2015-josh-01.jpg","caption":"Some of Josh’s cartoons generating quite a lot of interest","set":"josh","width":3289,"height":2642},{"image":"conference-2015-josh-02.jpg","caption":"Badger, badger, badger (mushroom, mushroom)","set":"josh","width":3184,"height":2388},{"image":"conference-2015-team-01.jpg","caption":"Teachers receive a warm welcome from Team Firefly","set":"team"},{"image":"conference-2015-team-02.jpg","caption":"Abi and David","set":"team"},{"image":"conference-2015-team-03.jpg","caption":"Fireflies queue for lunch","set":"team"}],"tags":["conferences","firefly"],"filename":"54","content":"<p>Aside from <a href=\"http://www.bettshow.com/\">The Bett Show</a>, the Firefly Learning Conference is our biggest UK event of the year.

I’m not a teacher, but I do work for a tech company whose goal it is to make education better.</p>\n<p>Recently the <a href=\"https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/frequent-use-school-computers-impairs-learning-finds-international\"><abbr title=\"Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\">OECD</abbr> released a report</a> that suggested that the use of technology in the classroom was having a detrimental effect on how well pupils were performing in standardised tests. As an organisation who really takes the time to try and understand education, Firefly certainly had a few thoughts on the report. One of our founders, Joe Mathewson, <a href=\"http://fireflylearning.com/blog/is-technology-good-or-bad-for-schools\">shared his thoughts on the report</a> on The BBC News Channel.</p>\n<p>As one of the people who designs software  used by hundreds-of-thousands of students, teachers and parents every day I have a responsibility to help build something genuinely useful. What we’re hearing loud-and-clear from teachers is that technology is just another tool, and is only useful when used alongside other tools and teaching methods.</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CatScutt\">Cat Scutt</a>, Head of Learning Technology and Innovation at the Girls’ Day School Trust, recently commented in her <a href=\"https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-views/yin-and-yang-using-mobile-technology-classroom\">TES article</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[E]ven if we focus on [academic achievement] alone, there is a fundamental flaw here in treating ICT as if it is a pedagogical approach in itself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It’s with this in mind that I’d like to consider what’s next for the classroom. Currently, mobile is the disrupter of the technological status quo. With tablets and phones now ubiquitous, computers have entered every part of the school day. But what happens next is anyones guess; the future is up for grabs. Of course there are indicators of what’s to come, decisions those in the know are making today that <em>may</em> affect the technology of tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Recently, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10101319050523971\">Facebook brought Oculus Rift</a> for $2billion. So why did they invest in a technology that seemed to have died on its arse in the mid 1980s? Well, Mark Zuckerberg certainly seems to be convinced <abbr title=\"Virtual Reality\">VR</abbr> is the next big thing in tech:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We have a lot more to do on mobile, but at this point we feel we’re in a position where we can start focusing on what platforms will come next.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Of course, not everyone is thrilled about Facebook’s acquisition of Oculus, some even suggesting that billionaire Zuckerberg simply loved the device, so he bought the company. However, it’s hard to ignore his vision, and it’s pretty clear what a difference <abbr title=\"Virtual Reality\">VR</abbr> could make to could make to the world beyond just games.</p>\n<p>A world stuffed full of Facebook ads aside, if <abbr title=\"Virtual Reality\">VR</abbr> is due to replace the screen, and change the way we interact with our environment, what does this mean for the classroom?</p>\n<h2>Early adopters</h2>\n<p>An enterprising teacher could, if they wished, start using <abbr title=\"Virtual Reality\">VR</abbr> now. Oculus sell <a href=\"https://www.oculus.com/en-us/dk2/\">Developer kits</a> so those with coding skills can build pretty much any experience they wish.</p>\n<p>Imagine a physics teacher explaining the structure of an atom to their students by immersing them in a world where she’s able to zoom deep into the environment and show the students how the atoms of their desks are arranged. If that sounds far-fetched then have a look at <a href=\"http://tomorrow-projects.com/classroom/\">the tomorrow project</a>, helping school children build their own 3D printable robots.</p>\n<p>I imagine some teachers and parents might see this as the ultimate nightmare scenario for the classroom; rows of students, all wearing goggles, hooked into the schools mainframe. No one speaks as information is simply downloaded into the student’s brain.</p>\n<p>What I’m suggesting here is something quite different. Unlike mobile devices, which by their nature prevent real-world social interactions, Virtual Reality simply adds another layer on top. This augmented reality would support real-world interactions in a way that mobile never can. However, I do think that the success of <abbr title=\"Virtual Reality\">VR</abbr> used in this way will very much depend on how unobtrusive the <abbr title=\"Virtual Reality\">VR</abbr> headsets / glasses / contact lenses can be made.</p>\n<h2>Wider integration</h2>\n<p>I think the mobile revolution has shown us that much of the technology innovation happening in schools is driven by students. Many schools have now adopted one to one or <abbr title=\"Bring Your Own Device\">BYOD</abbr> programmes as a direct kick-back against the tidal wave of devices being brought into school anyway, choosing to utilise technology, rather than have it serve only as a distraction.</p>\n<p>As with anything new, there have been varying levels of success, and the <abbr title=\"Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\">OECD</abbr> report is evidence of that. Personally, I think we’re over the initial hump. Teachers and <abbr title=\"Senior Leadership Teams\">SLTs</abbr> are much more switched on to the potential of mobile computing devices, and their pitfalls. The same will be true of future technology. As <abbr title=\"Virtual Reality\">VR</abbr> becomes more prevalent in everyday life, schools will learn how best to integrate it into their classrooms.</p>\n<h2>Alternative technologies</h2>\n<p>Another technology in its infancy, and one which has huge potential for schools, is smart surfaces. I recently listened to an extremely interesting <a href=\"https://royalsociety.org/stay-in-touch/rss/\">podcast from the Royal Society</a> called &quot;seeing clearly&quot;, in which <a href=\"http://www.phy.cam.ac.uk/directory/dr-dan-credgington\">Dr Dan Credgington</a> gave a brief outline of how we generate light, more specifically how we use <abbr title=\"Light Emitting Diode\">LED</abbr> technology to generate light.</p>\n<p>One of the areas he touched on was future materials, and how LEDs could be used to transform whole surfaces into light producing smart surfaces, and therefore, smart screens. Not only might this improve concentration levels in classrooms (by making the whole ceiling the light we could generate an ambient light level much closer to that of natural sunlight) but we could transform <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodeck\">all surfaces in the classroom into screens</a>.</p>\n<h2>Fanciful imaginings</h2>\n<p>Its fun to imagine what’s next, but for now all of us at Firefly are concentrating on our next set of apps for teachers, students and parents. And, as far as I know, we’ve no plans to release these for Facebook <abbr title=\"Virtual Reality\">VR</abbr> 1.0. At least, not yet anyway.</p>\n"},{"date":"2015-09-05T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Old hobbies die hard","tags":["drawing"],"images":[{"image":"2015-09-05_001.jpg","caption":"Toonin’ on a Saturday night","set":"cover"},{"image":"2015-09-05_002.jpg","set":"rabbits","caption":"Huey"},{"image":"2015-09-05_005.jpg","set":"rabbits","caption":"Dewey"},{"image":"2015-09-05_004.jpg","set":"rabbits","caption":"Louie"}],"filename":"52","content":"<p>As I kid I loved to draw cartoons.

I love it, not least as it lets me serve content directly from Github. Updating the site is as simple as pushing into my repository. I have no servers to maintain and no extra monthly costs. For a low traffic site it seems, for now at least, like the perfect solution.</p>\n<p>(figure set:artwork)</p>\n<p>To me, one of the most interesting things about writing a blog is the ability to look back, to make old posts new again with an easily navigable archive section. A key part of that is the ‘archives for year …’ page. However, hosting with Github pages means that I can’t use plugins for Jekyll that you’d normally need to achieve this. Jekyll doesn’t really offer much in the way of core functionality for archives, but with a bit of hacking you can create an archive page for every year in a way that doesn’t suck.</p>\n<p>We can use the power of <a href=\"http://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/\">Jekyll collections</a> to <em>somewhat</em> automatically generate an archive page for each year your site has posts. There’s three main parts to the setup:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Configure a collection for archives.</li>\n<li>Create a post for each year for which you want an archive page.</li>\n<li>Create a layout for processing each archive post into <abbr title=\"Hyper Text Markup Language\">HTML</abbr></li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Configure the archives collection</h2>\n<p>First, we need to tell Jekyll about our new collection. In my site configuration file, (usually <code>_config.yml</code>) I added the following:</p>\n<pre><code>collections:\n  archives:\n    output: true\n    permalink: /archives/:path/\n</code></pre>\n<p>This tells Jekyll that we want a collection called <strong>archives</strong>, that we want it to output an <code>index.html</code> for each item in the collection, and we want it to do so under the <code>/archives</code> url.</p>\n<h2>Create a post per year</h2>\n<p>Our new archives collection will read any markdown files in a folder named <code>_archives</code>, so we’ll have to create a post for each year your site has posts in this folder. This is why I say that this method is only <em>somewhat</em> automatic, however we’ll only every have to worry about updating this once per year.</p>\n<p>For example, if we want an archive page for 2015 at <code>archives/2015</code> we’d create the post <code>_archives/2015.md</code>. The only thing that’s really required here is YML front matter, here’s a simplified version of my <code>2015.md</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>---\ntitle: Archives for 2015\nyear: &quot;2015&quot;\nlayout: archive-year\n---\n</code></pre>\n<p>Don’t forget the quotation marks, the reason for them will shortly become apparent.</p>\n<h2>Archive page layout</h2>\n<p>Now we need to define a layout that Jekyll will use to output each archive page. I did this in a layout  <code>_layouts/archive-year.html</code>. Here’s a simplified version of my file:</p>\n<pre><code>---\nlayout: default\n---\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n\n{% for post in site.posts %}\n    {% capture post_year %}{{ post.date | date: '%Y' }}{% endcapture %}\n    {% if post_year == page.year %}\n            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;{{ site.baseurl }}{{ post.url }}&quot;&gt;{{ post.title }}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;       \n    {% endif %}\n{% endfor %}\n\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Its all pretty simple really. We’re looping though all the posts on the site, and only displaying them if they match the target year. By the way, those quotation marks from earlier are required for matching the <code>post_year</code> with <code>page.year</code>, which both have to be strings</p>\n<p>And that’s it. A <em>sort-of</em> automatic way to generate an archive page-per-year.</p>\n"},{"date":"2015-03-21T00:00:00.000Z","title":"What I talk about when I talk about beards","images":[{"image":"IMG_0184.jpg","caption":"The final product, far from perfect","set":"beard"},{"image":"IMG_0199.jpg","caption":null,"set":"shave"},{"image":"IMG_0208.jpg","caption":"The progress — What a knob","set":"shave"}],"cover":"IMG_0184.jpg","introduction":"_Twiddle, twiddle, scratch, scratch, scratch_.

Such has been my life over the past month. That ends this evening; the beard is gone.</p>\n<p>To share this tale of beard butchery, let me first set the scene: It’s 2015 and in the towns and villages of England the common hipster is alive and well. You’ll see him wherever you go, seeking to fit in with as little of what’s popular as possible.</p>\n<p>One thing this sub-non-culture of  has brought about is the resurgence of the beard. Please, hold the letters explaining how beards were popular long before the hipsters moved in; I know this, but as they’re so common place, down our way, I believe this was the thing that got me thinking about face-rugs. This, and a chap called Marc at work had grown the most impressive beard I’d ever seen on a real-life human man. It was like a Norse god had taken up residence in our office.</p>\n<p>It was, at the start of March, I had the thought of letting my face hair grow, unimpinged for as long as I could stand it.</p>\n<p>After a couple of weeks it was clear that this wasn’t going to be as easy as I’d first thought. Far from the majestic swept back locks that adorn the faces of Hittite statues, mine was more akin to the bush that lines the driveway at the end of our road.</p>\n<p>It was at this point I decided I needed some help. Having heard Marc talking about oiling his beard, I thought “Oh, I should <em>totally</em> do that!”. I, like, <em>totally</em> did too, using some of Katie’s pregnancy belly oil. It was the worst. By the end of the day my face smelled like a dead badger that’d been out in the sun for several days. Google to the rescue, and I found <a href=\"http://www.percynobleman.com/product/beard-oil/\">Percy’s beard oil</a>. Yes, it’s probably as hipster as hipster can be, but it’s also a brilliant product.</p>\n<p>Beard oil in hand I ploughed on, and was rewarded, even if I do say so myself, with half decent face hair. <em>Emphasis on the “half”</em>.</p>\n<p>(figure set:beard)</p>\n<p>So, why the change of heart? Why is the beard no more? Well, to be honest, it was all too much like hard work. Oh sure, I was a prince amongst men, but it all got a little too much. I couldn’t stop playing with it for one, not great if you want a great beard. Also, food would occasionally get stuck in there, and that’s a look that’s not that easy to carry off. The writing was on the wall for el beardo.</p>\n<p>Of course, I performed the obligatory shaving-off-into-stupid-styles ceremony, many of which, upon seeing my face, Katie threatened divorce.</p>\n<p>(figure set:shave)</p>\n<p>If this month has taught me anything, it’s that a good beard is no easy thing. It takes work. It takes the ability to leave it the hell alone.

We’ve also worked with some fantastic schools, creating bespoke themes, which gave us a wealth of ideas of the features students and teachers really want.</p>\n<p>Using this feedback, we were able to distill a clear list of the <em>type</em> of themes schools wanted, along with the customisation options that would appeal. We determined to build three new themes: One a playful, friendly theme; Another, clean and succinct; Lastly, a super minimalist theme.</p>\n<p>When I joined, just over three years ago, Firefly were five people crammed into a small office hidden away in a dark corner of One Lyric Square. The design department consisted of me and a pack of half empty Sharpies. Today we’re a forty strong team, with three (soon to be four) designers, with our own office in sunny Brighton. Over the summer holidays we were joined by intern <a href=\"http://www.adammmarsh.com\">Adam Marsh</a> and, with his help, we set about designing the new themes.</p>\n<p>(figure set:team)</p>\n<p>I’m really proud of the hard work the entire team put in creating the new themes.

After the damp squib that was our final day in Italy, the well-appointed campsite <a href=\"http://www.lidomappo.ch\">Lido Mappo</a> was most welcome. And, what luck! A break in the weather which allowed Katie and I to get our tent up and once again double our living space. That evening we paid a brief (but expensive) visit to the campsite bar, then cooked-up a pasta-storm back at chez-Roobottom.</p>\n<p>We awoke on Tuesday to beautiful sunshine. Using a combination of extremely poor Italian and much better English (on the part of the campsite staff) we’d established the the thing to do 'round these parts was to take the air with a brisk walk into Lacarno.</p>\n<p>Being near the border Lacarno has brilliant mixture of Italian Joie de vivre and Swiss preciseness, that for us <em>slightly</em> obsessive compulsive types, is infinitely appearing. We ate pizza in the square before hiking up the many almost vertical side-streets to explore.</p>\n<p>(figure set:lacarno-square)</p>\n<p>I think the most abiding memory of this place is the view over the lake. I don’t really think there’s anything to separate this place from Lake Garda, it’s just different, but equally beautiful. I managed to get some pictures that <em>almost</em> capture some small part of it’s beauty. I imagine it’s hard to communicate the feeling you associate with a place through pictures or words alone. It’s probably why those that do are few and far between. I’m certainly not counting myself there, if you were wondering.</p>\n<p>(figure set:lake-magorie)</p>\n<p>In the afternoon we took the camper up the mountain to the Verzasca Dam where apparently, if you’re so inclined, you can do a <a href=\"http://www.trekking.ch/en/bungy/007-bungy-jumping-verzasca-like-james-bond\">220m bungee jump</a> just like James Bond in Goldeneye. As we weren’t feeling <em>that</em> adventurous we made do with scaring ourselves by gawping over the fence at the dizzying drop. Why, after seeing that, you’d want to tie a piece of elastic around your legs and jump off I really couldn’t guess.</p>\n<p>(figure set:verzasca)</p>\n<p>On Wednesday we moved on to Germany, excited for our next adventure, but with the glimpse of the heavy heart that always accompanies a return to reality after a spectacular holiday. And spectacular this holiday has certainly been. It seems surreal at this point we’ve already driven nearly 2,000 miles. Pat on the head, van, for not letting us down — Thank goodness we didn’t buy a VW.</p>\n<p>It’s a sign of how far north we now were that we saw the first British numberplate for almost two weeks. Then another, and another. By the time we arrived at <a href=\"http://www.trendcamping.de\">Trend Camping</a> we were surrounded by the buggers.</p>\n<p>(figure set:trendcamping)</p>\n<p>The campsite had a rather nice bar which severed traditional German fare and local ales. So, despite the mud, it got the thumbs up from us. Especially when we discovered the huge power-showers, with massaging side-jets and everything. Luxury.</p>\n<p>On Thursday we used the free bus and train pass that the campsite provided to visit the nearby <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfach\">Wolfach</a>, a jolly little place that was once the hub of log-rafting and home to the pom-pom hat.</p>\n<p>The center of the town is lovely, with cobbled streets and shops full of delicious looking things. It’s surrounded by glorious grassy hills and meadows, the kind you might imagine yourself running through into the arms of a Bavarian maiden. If you were so inclined.</p>\n<p>(gallery set:wolfach)</p>\n<p>And then it was Friday. Only two days left of our holiday. How did that happen? Oh well, we thought, nothing for it but to spend some time in Belgium.</p>\n<p>What an amazing find for our last night. <a href=\"http://www.iledefaigneul.com\">Camping Ile de Faigneul</a> is a site on it’s own island in the middle of a river. We’d have loved to spend more time in this tranquil place, but alas this was just an overnight stop on our way to Calais, the tunnel and home.</p>\n<p>(figure set:faigneul)</p>\n<p>We spent that last night as we did some many others, eating pasta, playing cards and watching Mad Men.</p>\n<p>So it was with heavy hearts that we made our way thorough France to the Eurotunnel.

The end of a fantastic adventure that was entirely too short. It got dark at some point while were under the sea.

Headphones in, I’m listening to Fink’s “Sort of Revolution” extremely loud and enjoying an ice-cold beer. I lean my head back, and close my eyes against the sun as it dapples through the leaves above me. In the distance are the mountains that circle Lake Garda. Sparse clouds are suspended, seemingly motionless over the azure blue waters. Fuelled by the warmth of the sun, the melodic beat of the music and the haze from the alcohol I feel an almost zen-like sense of well-being. “This is perfect” I thought.</p>\n<p>In contrast to week one, when we’d travelled through five countries, we decided to slow the pace a little. After an epic drive our first stop was the Northern lake town of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nago–Torbole\">Torbole</a>, the windsurfers paradise, and <a href=\"http://www.campingalporto.it/camp/\">Camping Al Porto</a>. It felt Newquay-esq where board-shorts seemed to be the must-have fashion item of the season. The campsite was rather busier than those we’d been used to, but we managed to fit our van and awning on a shaded pitch thirty-seconds walk from the lake.</p>\n<p>(figure set:torbole)</p>\n<p>On the occasion of our first night in Italy, we did what we have the last two trips here: Find the most touristy looking restaurant and order the biggest pizza they have and a glass of the local beer. In this case it was <a href=\"http://www.forst.it/eng\">Forst</a>, brewed “just up the road” we were told.</p>\n<p>The next day we had ideas of taking windsurfing lesson but the wind didn’t seem to want to blow. It was probably too hot, so like us it decided to spend the day sunbathing and exploring the town. We also finally got the BBQ to work despite the crappy “just light the bag” charcoal, thanks to some German firelighters that almost took my face off.</p>\n<p>It was at this point we cheated a little by spending a few nights in a hotel south of the lake in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desenzano_del_Garda\">Desenzano del Garda</a>. “You know” said Katie “I’m loving being able to get out of the shower and being able to keep my feet dry.” I knew what she meant. I’m not proud to admit it but we really did wallow in the luxurious of it all.</p>\n<p>(gallery set:hotel)</p>\n<p>Peeling ourselves away from the hotel pool we ventured down the road to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirmione\">Sirmione</a>. Navigating the spit of land that forms a sort of natural pier into the centre of the southern bank of the lake — we parked and ventured over the bridge into down-town Sirmione. Here we indulged our inner tourist once again by eating gelato and watching the sunset.</p>\n<p>(figure set:sirmione)</p>\n<p>Having made a large dent in our holiday funds we checked out of the hotel and moved north around the lake to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazise\">Lazise</a>. Here we encountered the full glory of the Italian campsite. When you’re a good few kilometres from the centre on the main road you start to notice the signs. At first a just few, then more with increasing ferocity until they line the bank of the lake one after the other. You’re not, as we discovered, just expected to pick one and check-in. We spent an interesting couple of hours driving from site to site inspecting toilet blocks, pools, children’s entertainment and on-site bars before we finally gave in and just picked one.</p>\n<p>(figure set:lazisesite)</p>\n<p>Here we stayed and for four glorious days enjoyed the private beach and exploring the beautiful town. We swam, snorkelled and sunbathed. Ate gelato, pizza and even brought a fridge-magnet. No messing about, this was a proper holiday.</p>\n<p>Alas, it was time to move on. Switzerland and our final week beaconed.

On the second day we managed to peel ourselves away and drove into Baden-Baden, where we partook of some very European things like eating outside and strolling along the promenade.

Phew.</p>\n<p>(figure set:baden)</p>\n<p>Sad as we were to leave, Salzburg beckoned, so we packed up the van and set off. This was another sweaty drive along Euro-route 52. Six hours later we were lost in the city. In situations like this Katie stays calm and I tend to overreact (a little). Ahem.

I’d once been here on a school trip but the only thing I remember with any clarity was the McDonalds. Katie kept insisting that the hills were alive with the sound of music, but I wasn’t sure what she meant by this.</p>\n<p>Arriving by bus into Mozartsteg we made our way through the square, past the stalls selling Bavarian hats and up the hill to the fortress Hohensalzburg. After exploring for a bit we sat, pretzel and beer in hand, admiring the stunning view over the mountains.</p>\n<p>(figure set:salzburg)</p>\n<p>Next, I discovered a little more about those musical hills with a Sound of Music themed bus tour of the city.

I decided to abandon any highfalutin design ideas and just stick to a few core principals that would allow me to grow this site organically.</p>\n<p>First was the logo. I’d been sketching some ideas around a typographic “roo” for a while. A kangaroo was also an obvious choice. The final result is the emblem you see at the top of this page. Not perfect by any means, but a good starting point. I’ll no doubt change it as the site grows.</p>\n<p>(figure set:logo)</p>\n<p>Secondly to start with core elements then work out from there. Creating a pleasant and easy-to-use website is key to this idea, but it’s more than that. By letting the content do the work and keeping the design as subtle as possible I’m striving for (but probably rarely achieving) a browsing experience that feels effortless.</p>\n<p>I’ve chosen <a href=\"http://getkirby.com\">Kirby</a> as my <abbr title=\"Content Management System\">CMS</abbr>, this has so far proven to be the perfect fit, allowing me to write content in the fantastic <a href=\"http://www.iawriter.com\">iA Writer</a> using <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown\">Markdown</a> so I always start with uncluttered, unformatted text.</p>\n<p>And finally, stop procrastination and just launch the bloody thing! I’ve spent entirely too many late nights debugging css to wait any longer. It’s a personal project that’ll grow. So here it is, warts and all.</p>\n"}],"uri":"page-6"},{"items":[{"date":"2013-05-20T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Snowdonia Slateman Triathlon","section":"articles","tags":["fitness"],"images":[{"image":"slateman_1.jpg","caption":"The very well organised transition","set":"slateman_1"},{"image":"slateman_2.jpg","caption":"Conquering champions","set":"slateman_2"},{"image":"slateman_3.jpg","caption":"The beautiful Llyn Padarn","set":"slateman_3"}],"cover":"","filename":"38","content":"<p>Yesterday I swam in a freezing-cold lake; rode my bike up a mountain pass; then ran around an old slate mine.</p>\n<p>When <a href=\"http://twitter.com/imrazkhan\">Raz</a> and <a href=\"http://twitter.com/cleggmatt\">Matt</a> suggested it last year it seemed like such a good idea; they’d just seen the 2012 Slateman on TV and were raring to go. After some gental persuasion I reluctantly agreed to the shorter sprint distance of 400m swim, 20km cycle and a 6km run.</p>\n<p>In the end neither Raz or Matt could make the race due to reasons undisclosed. Luckily my friend Christian was entered for the full distance, so we packed up the van, banged on the tunes and made the 6 hour trek up to Wales.</p>\n<p>(figure set:slateman_3)</p>\n<p>Race day dawned and we made our weary way from our campsite to the lake ready for the briefing. The sun was just starting to clear away the early-morning clouds as we wheeled our bikes into Transition. I laid out my kit the best I could then, remebering a tip I’d read on a website, walked around mentally tracing my steps from the swim exit to the bike.</p>\n<p>I really wasn’t sure what to expect, especially when it came to the swim and the water temperature. I’d done a few sea-swims, but the lake was around 12℃, a little colder than I was used to. I needn’t have worried though, despited a little bit of cold-shock I managed to complete the swim in 12m26s, surprisingly in the middle of the field.</p>\n<p>Transition was a weird experience, I <em>did</em> manage to remove my wetsuit without too much falling over myself but then forgot my race belt and had to embarrassingly run back from the mount line to collect it.</p>\n<p>It was such a relief to get the swim and T1 out of the way that I <em>may</em> have gone out a little too fast on the bike. Still I managed to maintain a decent pace and completed the cycle in 57m30s.</p>\n<p>T2 was an altogether more relaxed affair and I was feeling pretty good knowing the end was in sight. I exited transition onto the run corse feeling pretty please with myself.</p>\n<p>(figure set:slateman_1)</p>\n<p>That was until I hit the first climb. I was pleased to see I wasn’t the only one walking and as we went higher the views more than made up for the burning calves. With some really fun, fast downhill sections the run finally led me back past transition to the finish line. I felt elated that I’d manage to finish my first triathlon in 1h54m47s.</p>\n<p>(figure set:slateman_2)</p>\n<p>There was a unique atmosphere I’ve not felt in any run or cycle event I’ve taken part in. I’m not sure if all Tri events are like this, or whether it was just the Slateman. Kudos to the organisers, it was a fantastic day. I always felt I knew where I should be, what I should be doing and (most importantly) that my kit was safe.</p>\n<p>If you’d like to give it a go <a href=\"http://snowdoniaslateman.com/\">entries for 2014 open on 22nd July</a>.</p>\n"},{"date":"2009-01-09T00:00:00.000Z","title":"the Silly Old Sods","section":"articles","cover":"/assets/blog/covers/Silly-Old-Sod-travels-around-the-country-on-a-bus-pass-03-04-13.jpg","images":[{"image":"Silly-Old-Sod-travels-around-the-country-on-a-bus-pass-03-04-13.jpg","caption":"Uncle Bill and his mate Dave","set":"sos"}],"filename":"37","content":"<p><strong>Katie</strong>'s uncle <strong>Bill</strong> is about to embark on a harebrained scheme to raise some cash for the <abbr title=\"Royal National Lifeboats Institution\">RNLI</abbr>.

I’ve tried to name each and every one of you who made 2008 such an amazing year.</p>\n<h2>January</h2>\n<p>Brr, January - There was <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/roobottommobile/2209064397\">snow</a>, My car reached <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/roobottommobile/2209860514\">111,111 miles</a>, and I finally got to see <strong>Rob &amp; Bekki Cotton</strong> on <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/roobottommobile/2209861688\">their barge</a>! One thing that does standout was the trip that <strong>Matt Clegg</strong>, <strong>Ben Marklew</strong>, <strong>John McNally</strong> and I took to the lakes to climb <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coniston_Old_Man\">The Old Man of Coniston</a>. A top weekend that, thinking back, makes me want to do more outdoor related stuff this year. You know, like the BIG outdoors rather than the tiny stuff you get in your local high street after stepping out of the kabab shop at 3am.</p>\n<p>(figure set:coniston)</p>\n<p>On January 15th it was a year since Katie’s dad passed away. <strong>Tony Sellwood</strong> was an amazing man… I tried to write something fitting about him shortly after he died, but couldn’t find the words. Similarly now, I’m struggling, but as the second year anniversary approaches in 2009 I remember him fondly as a joker with more time for people than anyone else I’ve ever met. I know he’s with God.</p>\n<h2>February</h2>\n<p>February was a bit of a mixture. At work, Glubble Family Edition was launched to a somewhat mixed reception. My abiding memory of this time was spending late nights at my parents (when our net connection was down) till 3am chatting with <strong>Ian Hayward</strong>, pushing pixels around interface designs.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere, <strong>Katie</strong> and I took a long weekend to Bath. I dunno why we did, but I’m sure that we did, as I have <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/roobottom/2327119659\">photographic evidence</a>. Life at Cherrytree was fun, as always, and <strong>Matt Clegg</strong> managed to bake a pie with the edibility of mild steel.</p>\n<p>(figure set:cleggpie)</p>\n<h2>March</h2>\n<p>As I write this review, it’s now that I wish I’d blogged more and taken a whole heap of photos. What did you achieve in March 2008 Jon? Oh, well, Katie and I dressed up like knobs and went to a party.</p>\n<p>(figure set:party)</p>\n<h2>April</h2>\n<p>April is my birthday month (just in-case you were thinking of buying me a present) and in 2008 I experienced my first ever <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/roobottom/2431709662/in/datetaken/\">Coke Float</a> thanks (mainly) to the fine work of <strong>Richard Kemp</strong>. I have yet to find a way to repay him for bringing such joy into my life. By this point of 2008 I was spending more and more of my time in Littlehampton (something to do with this random girl I met) and in <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/roobottom/sets/72157604532486601/\">April “LA” got snow</a>! Ah snow on the beach, <strong>Mark Wilson</strong>, <strong>Kamran &amp; Ellie Khan</strong>, <strong>Katie</strong> and I very much enjoyed pelting each other with snowballs.</p>\n<p>But by far the best thing about April was going to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isles_of_Scilly\">Scilly Isles</a>. It was hard to believe that just over a week before we’d had snow as, when we got there, it was hot hot hot! <strong>Sea Legs</strong> (heretofore know as <strong>Cath Hyslop</strong>), <strong>Katie</strong>, <strong>Katie’s Mum</strong> and I all spent a week in Sea Leg’s Mum’s cottage. Katie and Cath had years of family holiday history on the tiny islands, and had spent 6 months living and working on Scilly before traveling Australia for a year - So they knew most of the locals, but best of all knew all the best pubs.</p>\n<p>(figure set:waa)</p>\n<h2>May</h2>\n<p>The start of <em>some</em> warm weather prompted me to take the plunge and invest in some running shoes. And, needless to say, I was less than delighted when my first efforts yielded a total distance of 100 yards and a collapsed lung. Over the coming months though I did get <em>slightly</em> better, and having run an impressive <em>slightly further</em> I took the decision to enter a half marathon in February 2009. Which, actually, now I come to think about it is not very far off at all…Oh dear.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, our lovely (and by this I mean not at all a bunch of money-grabbing jobs-worths) letting agents had informed us that the landlord wanted to sell Cherrytree and we had to move out at the end of July. The hunt was on to find a new place where I, <strong>Matt Heaton</strong>, <strong>Matt Clegg</strong> and <strong>Steve Clark</strong> could live. Not too much effort went into this initially, after all how hard could it be to find a four bedroom house for let in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walsall\">Walsall</a>? To four, very, <em>very</em> clean living young gentlemen…</p>\n<h2>June</h2>\n<p>June went by in a blur. We still weren’t putting in too much effort on the house front, it was hot and not a time for sitting in writing blog posts. So consequentially I can’t recall anything that happened. Maybe the best solution for June would be a sign saying: &quot;scene deleted&quot;.</p>\n<h2>July</h2>\n<p>July was a month of big decisions. We still couldn’t find a place to live, and the time was quickly drawing near when we’d have to say goodbye to our beloved Cherrytree. A place in a shared house became available in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Littlehampton\">Littlehampton</a> (aka LA), and it seemed to be a no-brainer. It was certainly a lot closer to Katie than Walsall. But in typical Jon Roobottom style I couldn’t decide what to do for the best. This was it, if I moved it meant I really liked this girl.</p>\n<p>Thanks to the sterling efforts of <strong>Dan Mayley</strong>, and praying more than ever before, I finally saw the light and took the plunge. It was around this time that Glaxstar offered me a deal whereby I’d go freelance, but they’d guarantee me hours for a considerable block of time. How could I not? I’d been itching to get my teeth into some freelance stuff for months - I bit their arm off. God is good.</p>\n<p>A week before I left I went camping in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coed-y-Brenin\">Coed y Brenin</a>, Wales with some old mates; <strong>Paul Lloyd</strong>, <strong>Kris Benbow</strong>, <strong>Jon Ford</strong>, <strong>Lewis Burden</strong>, <strong>Lee Nash</strong>, <strong>Dave Handley</strong>, <strong>Mark Gosling</strong> and <strong>Jon Macey</strong>. Awesome is all I can say, it came at just the right time. Let’s hope we can do it again in 2009.</p>\n<p>The day before I left <strong>Hannah Kemp</strong> threw me a party at chez-kemp. Having spent the last 4 years in Walsall Community Church, this was above and beyond the best send off I could have asked for. Guys, each and every one of you has made Walsall special, and I really can’t express what it meant to me to have you all there for the party. Chatting, drinking, relaxing and eating part cooked bbq spare ribs with each one of you is an absolute pleasure.</p>\n<p><strong>Matt H</strong>, <strong>Matt C</strong>, <strong>Adam</strong>, <strong>Steve</strong>, <strong>AJ</strong>, <strong>Kempy</strong>, <strong>Hannah</strong>, <strong>Minnie</strong>, <strong>Esther</strong>, <strong>Sarah</strong>, <strong>Dan &amp; Erin</strong>, <strong>Andy &amp; Sue</strong>, <strong>Raz</strong>, <strong>Paul</strong>, <strong>Lee</strong>, <strong>Kirsty</strong>, <strong>Katy &amp; Ben</strong>, <strong>Lou</strong> and <strong>Paul &amp; Esta</strong>… Thanks for turning up to say goodbye… or maybe just making sure I leave. So on Saturday 26th July 2008 <strong>Kempy</strong>, <strong>AJ</strong>, <strong>Steve</strong> and I packed up a big van and moved my stuff into my new house.</p>\n<h2>August</h2>\n<p>I love the summer, and August didn’t disappoint for once - or it may have done, depending on how reliable my memory is. But I recall August as hot. Katie and I travelled back to my <strong>Mum &amp; Dad</strong>'s place in Walsall for his 60th birthday. I think he ended up paying for the meal, so, thanks dad.</p>\n<p>(figure set:dadsbday)</p>\n<p>It was also the big fruits’ birthday, so we celebrated <strong>Angie Tuffill</strong> being another year older in style with an American themed party. I think prizes went to <strong>Kamran Khan</strong> for the best costume as <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/roobottom/2908969397\">Uncle Fester</a>, although he’s not a million miles away from that normally.</p>\n<p>I also got to relive my youth by finally getting to see <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Levellers\">The Levellers</a> live at <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arundel_Castle\">Arundel Castle</a>. By the looks of some of the older gentlemen in the crowd, they’d been reliving their youth from just after lunch and by 8pm they’d relived so much they were probably going to regret that one in the office on Monday morning.</p>\n<p>(figure set:levellers)</p>\n<h2>September</h2>\n<p>September saw <strong>Annie &amp; Christian Powell</strong> get hitched, which was good news for all of us as we knew they’d throw a decent party. And they didn’t disappoint, with not one wedding party but two. Apparently the rave on Sunday night went on till 3am. I’m sure the 3 huge barrels of ale that Christian had invested in helped there.</p>\n<p><strong>Kamran Khan</strong> and I decided to service my car, I mean, how hard could it be? We got all the stuff and set about the task. 6 hours later we’d changed the air filter, just about managed to swap the spark-plugs and put a hole in the drivers side floor. Well, I say &quot;we&quot;, but the hole was mainly my fault. Still, my car seemed to run all the sweeter for our efforts.</p>\n<p>(figure set:service)</p>\n<p><strong>Cath Hyslop</strong> got baptised! Admittedly I was supposed to get dunked too, but I’m not all that great at making decisions.</p>\n<p>(figure set:cathbap)</p>\n<h2>October</h2>\n<p>October is <strong>Katie</strong>'s birthday month, and in true southern style we and a <em>few</em> others went for an all you can eat Chinese. I feel we really didn’t take full advantage of the ‘all you can eat-ness’ of the thing, especially Katie who powered her way through starters only… Well, OK she had about 2 tonnes of fried seaweed, but that’s not the point.</p>\n<p>The month was also memorable for a day trip Katie and I took to London. I’d been to London so much for work related stuff over the last few months, it was really nice to spend some time (and LOTS of money) exploring the city.</p>\n<p>(figure set:bigben)</p>\n<p>October was also the month when our new <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_group\">cell</a> really took off. I’d arrived in LA at a point where the cell-group was in flux, <strong>Claire Jones</strong> had decided to take a well earned break from her leadership role and we were waiting for a someone to step into the breach. But in October we decided that we’d take our cell in a new direction, each week we’d take it in turns to lead with whatever God had put on our hearts to share. So far it’s worked extraordinarily well.</p>\n<h2>November</h2>\n<p>November was awesome because of the <a href=\"http://www.walsallcommunitychurch.org/\">WCC</a> men’s weekend away at Standlake Ranch in Oxfordshire. Like the weekend away in 2007 it was an amazing time with God, and He did so much in my life that weekend, perfectly building on the previous year with perfect timing for everything that was going on in my life.</p>\n<p>(figure set:toads)</p>\n<p><strong>Flix &amp; Maryanne Gillett</strong> got hitched too! Gotta say guys the bangers and mash was inspired, and Flix’s speech is possibly one of the best I’ve ever heard.</p>\n<h2>December</h2>\n<p>The early part of December saw <strong>Katie</strong> and <strong>Cath</strong> jetting off to Hong Kong “Hongers” for a few days. Was I jealous? Yeah, a little, but I flippin’ hate flying with a passion so avoiding the 12 hour flight was some small consolation.</p>\n<p>Later in the month <strong>Katie</strong> and I took a week’s holiday in Scotland. I’d told her that I’d booked a B&amp;B and found a suitably crappy looking random guest house on the internet to fool her with. I’d actually booked a private cottage with a hot tub as I’d hatched a bit of a plan. When we got there, the post code on the cottage website took us to some random housing estate. Not to worry I thought, it can’t be far, I’ll just drive around til we happen upon it. An hour later I was getting a little stressed as all my plans for a surprise were rapidly going down the toilet. In the end I had to confess all and Katie knocked doors until we found someone who’d heard of the place.</p>\n<p>When we eventually arrived at the cottage I thought I’d booked (as there we’re two on the website, a one bedroom place and a three bedroom place) the lights were on, and we could here voices in the garden. “Hello?” I shouted as I walked around to the rear of the cottage. I was really fuming now, over an hour to find the place and the owners had double booked it!</p>\n<p>I was greeted with sight of a naked couple in the hot tub, she quickly moved, but he just sat there, and I couldn’t help but glance at the thing that was floating in the crystal clear, illuminated, water. “Erm…” I said, &quot;Have you booked this place, cos I think I have&quot;. He was actually quite polite, and as we made a quick exit we noticed that the driveway continued on to a larger property just around the corner. In my haste and annoyance I hadn’t realised that the place I’d booked was actually the three bedroom cottage. Oh well, you live and learn.</p>\n<p>That night, Katie and I relaxed with a bottle of wine and the promise of the hot tub bubbling away outside. I couldn’t wait any longer, she was clearly impressed with the way I’d handled the naked man and the iron was hot to strike. I sat her down, got on one knee and asked her if she’d be my wife. “Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa… really?!” she said. And then just kept on saying it. Eventually I had to ask her if that was a 'yes’. The ring didn’t fit, we’d seen too much nakedness, and all we had for dinner was fish fingers and chips. But it didn’t matter, the place was brilliant, and she’d said yes. I couldn’t be happier.</p>\n<p>(figure set:ring)</p>\n<p>As 2008 drew to a close, 17 of us played a murder mystery and then on <strong>Florrie Fuller</strong>'s suggestion we played musical statues to the small hours. Thanks to everyone who made my year so awesome, you know who you are (even if you’re not mentioned by name here).

I even emailed O2 “Support” about this - to which their answer was “we know, we’re working on it, but don’t ask us how long to sort it 'cos our web team is clearly rubbish!”</p>\n<p>I could go on, but suffice to say that for a company who is as big as O2 you think they could afford to spend a few bob on some decent systems and developers.

The Bible says…</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you confess with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Well, as a basic statement of faith I believe that Jesus Christ is the way, the truth and the life of all humanity. He has given me abundant life, and given me new hope. When I returned from University in 2003, I was not a believer. In fact I cringed in embarrassment the one and only time I did make it to church. ‘What are these nutters doing?’ I thought, as all around me people we’re raising their arm and singing at the top of their voices in praise to their King.</p>\n<p>And then I went along again to church, for a friends wedding blessing. Again, at first, I was an awkward affair. I didn’t feel comfortable around these people making fools of themselves. But, right there in the middle of the midst of my embarrassment and endless questioning, God met me. I can describe this experience as nothing less than an amazing filling of God, the Holy Spirit. Things that I’d pushed right down, things I didn’t want to think about burst into my mind. The deep black endless pit of depression that I’d suffered with the previous five years was suddenly at the forefront of my mind. But there was something else, something much bigger than that; an overwhelming Joy.</p>\n<p>Tears streamed down my face as I too now worshiped God who’d given me this wonderful gift. It was a lightbulb moment, a sudden realisation that where I once thought there was nothing, there was indeed something. From that day I went looking for God. It wasn’t like I had that experience and that was it, I had to actively seek him out, read the Bible and spend time with Him.</p>\n"},{"date":"2008-05-28T00:00:00.000Z","title":"You know you're living in a shared house when","filename":"30","content":"<p>Ah, the joys of living with a bunch of lads.

When <a href=\"http://www.ianhayward.com/\">Ian Hayward</a> contacted me last April about doing some freelance stuff for <a href=\"http://www.glaxstar.com\">Glaxstar</a> he gave me an impassioned speech about how he had a vision about protecting young kids on the web.

What’s new?</h2>\n<p>Well, pretty much everything’s changed but the concept - So I’ll give you the top five coolest features.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Usertabs</strong> - These little suckers make it so easy to log into your Glubble user account. Simply click your tab and (if you’re a helper, kids don’t need passwords) enter your password to unlock Firefox. Oh, and the ability to auto-disable the browser lock has been added to.</li>\n<li><strong>Family Homepage</strong> - This is cool. You get your own family center where you can check out what your family’s been up to online and send each other little messages on your family wall.</li>\n<li><strong>The Glubble Library</strong> - The new Glubble Add-on comes with a whole load of “content bubbles” or Glubbles for your kids. These are basically groups of links that have been checked by our experts and are certified safe and fun for kids. The ability to create your own Glubbles and share them with family and friends is coming soon.</li>\n<li><strong>My Secret Homepage</strong> - Each child gets their own secret homepage containing all their most used content. They can also write on the family wall from here and pretty soon they’ll be other cool, customizable stuff they can do!</li>\n<li><strong>Visual Favorites</strong> - When a child adds a page to their Favorites (bookmarks) Glubble automagically creates a thumbnail of that page and puts it in their Bookmarks Bar for easy access. I want this Add-on for Firefox myself! It’s so much easier to remember what a site is from a screen shot rather than just a title.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Try Glubble</h2>\n<p>If you’ve got young kids and you’d like to give Glubble Add-on for <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com\">Firefox</a> a go.

As we landed at the tiny Besica airport we realised that the turbulence we had just endured was in fact heavy rain that drenched us as we ran from the plane to the cover of the arrivals lounge. From there we found ourselves sitting in the hire car, rain pounding on the windscreen, trying to get used to the uneasy feeling of sitting in the passenger side with a steering wheel in front of me. By the time we reached <a href=\"http://www.mistralhotels.it/admiral.htm\">our hotel</a> we’d driven on three motorways and had a tiny disagreement with a barrier.</p>\n<p>Thankfully the wing-mirror was unharmed and the rain had stopped to reveal blue sky. Things got even better when we got into our room - it was clean, big and had a balcony from which you could see the lake (sort of) through the trees. We spent the week exploring Lake Garda’s small towns and excellent restaurants, and venturing out to Verona and eventually Venice after planning to go on Wednesday and finally getting there on Friday - Due to a couple of days missing the train. Whoops!</p>\n<p>(figure set:lake2)</p>\n<p>My favourite place by far was Sirmione which was at the end of an tiny outcrop of land that juts into the south end of the lake. We spent an evening at the naturally heated <a href=\"http://www.termedisirmione.it/tds/en/homepage.html\">spa</a> followed by dinner at <a href=\"http://www.ristorantearcimboldo.com/\">L’Archimboldo</a> run by a really friendly guy who’s English was better than ours.

Stepping out of the station, you’re immediately greeted with throngs of people walking up and down the banks of the Grand Canal. Wow! We took a water taxi up to St. Marks Square and stopped for lunch and some shelter from the hot-hot sun before we ventured into St Mark’s Basilica and mooched around the Square, avoiding the millions of pigeons that randomly landed on anyone they fancied, whether they had food or not.</p>\n<p>We then set off around the labyrinth-like city on foot, exploring the seemingly unending passageways and tiny bridges. Needless to say we got horribly lost, and only just made our train back to the hotel. But I loved Venice, a day was just not enough. In usual style, I took nearly 700 photos - and you can <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/roobottom/sets/72157602449502521/\">see some of them over at flickr</a>.</p>\n<p>Oh well, back to reality I suppose.</p>\n"},{"date":"2007-09-11T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Pimp My Attitude","filename":"26","content":"<p>Last week I received a random e-mail from a lady calling herself “Yummy Mummy” that simply said…</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I have written about you, I hope you like it. x.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So with trepidation, I clicked on <a href=\"http://pimpmydaughter.wordpress.com/2007/09/04/jon-roobottom-the-churchgoing-hunk/\">the link</a>.

Apparently this woman, writing under the pseudonym of Yummy Mummy writes about “Amelia” her 18 year old daughter and how she needs to basically be more wise in the way of men. Its pretty weird stuff and morally questionable to say the least, but after a few emails to “Yummy” (staring with me asking ‘are you for real?’) I was assured that this wasn’t real, and was just to provoke interest in her blog.</p>\n<p>So needless to say, I don’t agree with what this woman is doing, but she has a much right to write what she thinks as the next guy… um, gal.

A huge shaggy dog that would visit him for a while.</p>\n<p>I really didn’t know what depression meant, I always thought it was something people said when they were a bit sad about something. It wasn’t until my first year at University that I felt the crushing grip of depression.</p>\n<p>For those of you that don’t know; depression isn’t feeling a little sad. It’s a deep dark pit of despair, it grips you like a vice, squeezing your stomach sending poison round your body. That first time at University was exactly this. I couldn’t face doing anything. I didn’t care what I looked like, I couldn’t interact with people anymore, something had broken inside me and I didn’t know what it was or how to make it better.  Slowly, so slowly I came out of it. I floundered there for a while, but it did get better.</p>\n<p>That was eight years ago. I remember for the longest time afterwards I was scared that It would come back, that the very act of being scared of it was going to cause it. Fear of fear itself.  I’ve had other bouts of it, mostly at University, but always come out the other side, perhaps a bit stronger for the experience.</p>\n<p>That brings me to today. And I’m feeling low again. I wouldn’t say that I was depressed because I can remember that feeling, and that was a <em>lot</em> worse. This is sporadic, occasionally punching me in the stomach when I’m least expecting it. I do know I’ll get better. Past experience teaches me that I <em>probably</em> wont feel like this forever.

It conjures images of far-flung island chains, sunkissed beaches and ragged shorelines. Twenty-eight miles off the southwestern tip of England is Cornwall’s own archipelago: The Isles of Scilly.</p>\n<p>The islands are a place of contrast. Beautiful yet wild. Bright white beaches nestle alongside sea ravaged cliffs. Windswept hills sit beside sheltered coves and inlets.</p>\n<p>My wife Katie and I have visited many times: With friends; As girlfriend and boyfriend; As husband and wife; And more recently, with our small family.</p>\n<p>This is my love letter to the Islands: A collection of memories from all those trips to Scilly. Out of order and somewhat idealised. The way good memories should be.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>The crossing</h2>\n<p><em>In 2012, Katie and I were due to fly via helicopter, alas it was grounded due to technical difficulty. We had to stay overnight in Penzance and catch the ferry the following day…</em></p>\n<p>Every morning, throughout the summer a passenger ferry departs from the quay in Penzance. Aboard you’ll find serval hundred seats, two cafés and thousands of small white bags in dispensers attached to the bulkheads.</p>\n<p>This is the <em><abbr title=\"Royal Mail Vessel\">RMV</abbr> Scillonian III</em>, and she’s been transporting excited — and occasionally green — tourists from the mainland to the Isles of Scilly since 1977.</p>\n<p>(figure set:scillonian,class:pull-both)</p>\n<p>There are more comfortable ways to get to the Scillies: A small seven-seater plane dubbed <em>Skybus</em> that flies from Lands End, Newquay or Exeter. And, in times past, there was a helicopter that flew from Penzance that was always our favourite way to get to the islands. Alas, this ceased operation at the end of 2012. We were booked on a mid-morning flight, but due to there being a large hole in the side of the helicopter, we were forced to overnight in a nearby hotel to catch the ferry the following day.</p>\n<p>On this particular voyage, we secured our regular spot on the middle deck, near the back door. This is the ideal spot for Katie to sit as motionless as possible and endure any rough crossing.</p>\n<p>Knowing the best thing to do is leave her alone, this position also avails me of an escape route outside to the upper deck. From here, it’s not unusual to spot gigantic shoals of fish or even dolphins in the wake of the engines. In rough water, this is also the optimal location to enjoy the power of the seas. And to keep a weathered eye on the horizon, just in case.</p>\n<p>At capacity, the Scillonian carries 485 souls some of whom line the upper deck like birds on a telephone wire. It’s a busy place to be, people perched atop benches, leaning on the rigging, or hanging over the rails.</p>\n<p>Whatever may come, we’re all now locked together for the two-hours and forty-five-minute trip. Knowing looks are passed over the heads of the unsuspecting day trippers by those of us who’ve travelled this way before. “Poor sods” our brief eye contact seems to say, as we don our pressure point travel bands and pop an array of chemical remedies for <em>mal de mare</em>.</p>\n<p>Luckily, all this preparation is for nought. Once we rounded Gwennap Head off Lands End, and are in full steam towards the islands, most of the more unpleasant effects of the sea are behind us. On a sunny day, there’s no better way to arrive on Scilly than by boat.</p>\n<p>What’s astonishing is the speed at which the passengers disappear once we’ve docked in St Mary’s harbour. Some hang around on the quay waiting for smaller tender boats to the off-islands. Most make the happy walk up the dock, past the Mermaid pub and along Hugh Street, draining off down the various alleyways and lanes to their holiday accommodations.</p>\n<p>At any one time throughout the summer there are thousands of visitors on the islands. And yet, it doesn’t ever feel busy. Scilly is full of secret places, quiet beaches and deserted coves.</p>\n<p>Our journey took us via the <a href=\"https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g488312-d1168609-Reviews-Kavorna_Cafe_Bistro-St_Mary_s_Isles_of_Scilly_England.html\">Kavorna Café</a> (to pick up our first Cornish pasty of the holiday), over Garrison Lane and onto Littleporth to where our friend’s mum has a place that looks out over Porthcressa beach.</p>\n<p>(figure set:view,class:pull-both)</p>\n<p>Naturally, the door is unlocked. Unloading our bags in the doorway, we made our way through the house and out into the garden. Finally, we sank into various bits of unmatched garden furniture and savoured our pasties in silence, taking in the gorgeous view, ready for our holiday to start.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>A lovely day for boating</h2>\n<p><em>In 2017, my wife Katie, daughter “Roo” and I visited Scilly along with our friends Cath and Dave…</em></p>\n<p>“Mummy! I want to get up now!”</p>\n<p>I turned over and looked at my watch. 8:05. Wow, she slept well.</p>\n<p>“Daddy!”</p>\n<p>OK, kid, give me a minute here. But Katie’s already out of bed and padding down the creaky corridor.</p>\n<p>“Shh, you’ll wake Cath and Dave”, I hear Katie tell <em>Roo</em>. Rolling over I caught a glimpse of the sun streaming in at the window. Time to get up.</p>\n<p>“Mummy, we on holy-day”,  <em>Roo</em> confidently tells Katie as they, by degrees, make their way down the corridor. Katie was taking significantly more care than <em>Roo</em>, who skipped down the hall like a demented rabbit.</p>\n<p>I joined my family in the Kitchen. It really was a gorgeous day. A quick check of the BBC’s weather app informed me that it’s a balmy twenty-five degrees with light winds. A lovely day for boating.</p>\n<p>After breakfast we executed our plan: Heading for St Martins. Five of us; intrepid seafarers standing on the quay, tickets in hand watching the <em>Sea King</em> draw alongside the waiting passengers.</p>\n<p>(figure set:seaking,class:pull-both)</p>\n<p>Landing at Higher Town, our first port of call was <a href=\"http://www.theislandbakery-stmartins.com/\">The Island Bakery</a> for the day’s supplies. Fully stocked with Cornish pasties and cola cake, we trundled up the single track road and over the brow of the hill before taking the path cut through a field overgrown with Scilly’s ubiquitous Bracken. The vast swathe of white sand of Great Bay was almost deserted. Besides a few families lounging here and there we’re the only people, so finding a sheltered spot was simple.</p>\n<p>(figure set:digging,class:pull-left)</p>\n<p>Seaside days used to be a relaxed affair but with <em>Roo</em> in tow, it’s now more like mobilising a beach assault. Once the shelter was up, beach mats laid out and sun cream applied, we unpacked the various excavating tools. Thankfully she’s still a bit too small to want to bury daddy, so digging giant holes was the order of the day. <em>Roo</em> took up her position as site foreman then Dave, and I set about our task of digging several large holes and interconnecting trenches. Eventually, the tide will come up and fill this carefully engineered system, much to <em>Roo’s</em> delight, after which Dave and I will have to frantically shore-up walls and rebuild various dams.</p>\n<p>All too soon the site whistle sounds for lunch.</p>\n<p>“Lads! Lunchtime!”</p>\n<p>Sated, crumb covered, and chocolate stained we emerged from lunch. If only <em>Roo</em> can have a nap in the beach shelter, maybe we can have a relaxing hour catching up on some reading. She doesn’t take much coaxing, exhausted from bossing us around she’s happy to sleep.</p>\n<p>One or two of us drifted off too. It’s hard not to in the warmth of the day and with the rhythmic whoosh of the sea lapping at the beach. On waking, I felt the need to burn off all that pasty. It’s was time to break out the wetsuit and snorkel and explore the crystal clear waters.</p>\n<p>Wetsuit, booties, flippers, mask and flippers. All the gear and no idea. Penguin-like, I gingerly waddled my way down to the shoreline and into the freezing waters of the Atlantic. Once waist-deep, I took a big breath and rolled forward into the water. Waiting for the cold water effect to pass, I wrangled the mask into position over my face and entered the underwater world.</p>\n<p>Below the water barrier, I’m in another world entirely. From the beach, I must look like Manatee in distress, but down in my aquatic environment, I felt like Jacques Cousteau about to discover some previously unimagined species.</p>\n<p>Further out the water was clear all the way to the bottom some five meters below, where Kelp forests sheltered shoals of fish. A sudden shot of panic as my lizard brain picked up movement in my peripheral vision: A large striped fish darted out of the Kelp. I followed at a distance. He came to rest in a clearing, and I was able to float above him and just watch for what seemed like an eternity.</p>\n<p>(figure set:snorkel,class:pull-both)</p>\n<p>“I saw a <em>massive</em> fish out there”, I announced to Katie, extending my arms to demonstrate its size, adding a few centimetres in the tradition of men everywhere when talking about the size of things.</p>\n<p>“That’s nice dear”, she replied. “But we need to pack up and go, or we’ll miss the last boat back.”</p>\n<p>Everyone was contemplative on the return to St Mary’s. Even <em>Roo</em> — who was up on her knees so she could see over the side — was uncharacteristically quiet. It was hard not to get lost in that view; the ocean glinting like a blanket of tiny diamonds, the twin islands of St. Agnes and Gugh slung low on the horizon.</p>\n<p><em>Roo</em> was asleep as soon as her head hit the pillow. Perfect, especially as Dave and Cath had kindly offered to babysit.</p>\n<p>A great tradition on our visits to Scilly — perhaps <em>the</em> tradition — is partaking in a scone or two at <a href=\"http://www.julietsgardenrestaurant.co.uk/\">Juliet’s Garden</a>. Perched on top of a hill, the garden offers spectacular views over Tresco. On a warm day, there’s nothing quite like sitting in Juliet’s Garden cramming copious amounts of scone and tea into ones face.</p>\n<p>(figure set:juliets,class:span-both)</p>\n<p>Juliet isn’t just famed for her cream teas, she also runs a fantastic restaurant. On arrival this evening, Katie and I were served drinks in the garden while watching the gorgeous sunset. Then, taking our seats inside, we were treated to an incredible three-course meal.</p>\n<p>As the evening was warm, and our bellies were full we decided to forego a taxi and walk. We sat a while on the flat rock above Town Beach and watched the boat lights bobbing around in the harbour. I don’t think either of us wanted the evening to end. Eventually, though, the lure of bed called us, and we reluctantly slunk back to the house. I often think of that romantic evening on the flat rock as one of my stand out memories of our trip that year. For me, a balmy evening watching small boats on the water <em>is</em> quintessentially Scilly.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>The Scilly Cart, Co.</h2>\n<p><em>In 2014, on our last holiday, before Roo was born, we visited Scilly with our friends Cath, Dave and Emily.</em></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.scillycart.co/\">Scilly Cart Co </a> used to have a Facebook page on which it posted pictures, usually taken by disgruntled locals, of the imperfect parking decisions taken by tourists when hiring a cart for the day. When you arrive at the Cart Co’s depot, you’re greeted with a display board of these photos followed by a pep-talk by the owner on the evils of annoying the locals with where you choose to park.</p>\n<p>(figure set:cart,class:pull-left)</p>\n<p>With these words of warning rising in our ears Dave and I pulled out onto the main road, each of us determined to follow the rules to the letter. How we ended up attempting to break the land-speed record is anyone’s guess. One moment we were driving along sensibly, the next we were bouncing up and down in our seats trying to squeeze every ounce of speed we could from our formula-z cart. Needless to say, we weren’t very successful, and no traffic laws were violated.</p>\n<p>After the girls were aboard, we set out along the Telegraph Road that circles the innards of the island. There was no plan beyond maybe finding a beach and most definitely finding somewhere for lunch. I’ve gotta admit that — despite appearances — driving a golf-buggy is crazy fun. So we kept driving, twice around the island in fact, before we eventually decided we needed some lunch.</p>\n<p>This was the birth of another great tradition: Lunch at <a href=\"http://www.scillycountryhouse.com/about-us/kaffeehaus/\">Kaffeehaus Salbei</a>, a German-inspired café and guesthouse. When it’s hot, and not too busy, you can get a table outside or else swelter inside the conservatory. The German Platter is a must, with homemade bread and Bavarian meats and cheeses. Then, of course, one must have either the Apfelstrudel or — my personal favourite — a slice of Sacher Torte. I swear the cart was noticeably slower after lunch. It was either the weight of the food, or the battery had taken a beating from our multiple laps of the island.</p>\n<p>Locals on the islands often supplement their income by making things, which are offered for sale by the side of the road. An honesty box is provided for you to remunerate the artist for their handiwork. There is such a place on Porth Loo Lane. With time on our hands, we parked the cart and went for a look.</p>\n<p>(figure set:fox,class:pull-right)</p>\n<p>This particular treasure-trove was in the craftsperson’s garden shed. Inside, we found all manner of items. Some cobbled together from flotsam and jetsam. Some reclaimed from household bits and bobs. One thing, in particular, caught Dave’s eye: A fox, made from an old piece of brown carpet. One mad button eye was sewn onto its face, another for its nose. It was beautiful. It was perfect. He had to have it. I think it is a source of great regret that he didn’t buy it there and then. We should have known really, but when we returned later it was already gone. I like to think of it in an ornamental frame, in pride of place above someone’s fireplace. Lucky buggers.</p>\n<p>Later, the cart safely returned with minimal damage, we headed to the Atlantic for dinner and the pub quiz. We were all too drunk (or too stupid) to answer any of the questions well, and “team bum trumpets” inevitably place dead last.</p>\n<p>On any other evening, a night-out on Scilly would end with the closing of the pub. But not tonight, tonight we were off to Barry’s.</p>\n<p>Once a week, Barry opens the doors to his basement for the world famous Barry’s Disco. Imagine the scene: 50 sweaty people dancing the night away in a tiny basement to the hot disco “hits” of the late 90s. God knows what time we finally got out of there. Needless to say, we all had a little lay-in the next morning.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Gigs</h2>\n<p><em>In 2009, without planning to, Katie and I visited St.Mary’s in the same week as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Pilot_Gig_Championships\">World Gig Pilot Gig Championships</a>…</em></p>\n<p>All week, St.Mary’s had been its usual, tranquil place: Little sailing boats had bobbed in the harbour; Gentle winds had blown across the sun-kissed beaches. And the island’s pubs and eateries had no queues at the bar or required bookings for dinner.</p>\n<p>That all changed on Friday morning when the Scillonian docked and brought ashore the first of the revellers who’d come to Scilly to enjoy the weekend’s racing. The Isles of Scilly Steamship Company runs the Scillonian twice-a-day on Gig weekends, dumping several thousand people on the islands in quick succession.</p>\n<p>The whole character of the island was transformed. Pubs, who’d obtained exclusive licences for the occasion, remained open 24-hours a day for the duration. There was a not-so-small minority of people who were here for the weekend, but hadn’t anywhere to stay, electing instead to spend their entire time in the boozer.</p>\n<p>This didn’t dent the enjoyment, far from it. Experiencing this new aspect of Scilly was exciting. Everyone was very jolly, and even a weekend fuelled by alcohol and little sleep didn’t seem to dampen their enthusiasm for cheering on their team.</p>\n<p>If you’re not familiar, a Cornish Pilot Gig is a six-person boat about 10 meters long and 1.5 meters wide. In addition to the six rowers, a Cox steers and shouts encouragement and is responsible for ensuring the crew makes land before last orders.</p>\n<p>Gigs are a common sight on the Scillies. Their names, like “Slippen”, “Bonnet” and “Nornour” pay homage to the memory of their namesakes who, in the 17th and 18th centuries, were used as transfer vessels to take Pilots out to larger ships. A Pilot was a local sailor who could navigate safely through the treacherous, rock-laden waters of the archipelago.</p>\n<p>We got chatting with a man in a pub. A misty-eyed old sea dog. He told us that it was often the case that more than one Pilot was available at any one time, and the first man to arrive would get the job. So the Gig crews took to racing, the fastest sailors would get paid, and that’s how the Gig races on the Isles started. It’s a romantic story, and I’d like to believe it’s true.</p>\n<p>The races start out at sea. The officials string a line buoys to form a start line out by Nut Rock. The crews then wait in their boats as close to the start line as they can. But woe betides any vessel that crosses the line before “go” is called. They get instantly disqualified.</p>\n<p>There are old rivalries and alliances between teams who come from all over the world. These all go out of the window once the call comes to start. Every crew for themselves. A crew of six, pulling for all their worth. From the start line, they race across the clear stretch of water to St.Mary’s harbour.</p>\n<p>From our vantage point up on the Garrison, it looks pandemonium; oars churning the sea into a raging torrent. All around the Gigs are the island’s small ferry boats filled to bursting with spectators who’ve paid for the privilege of a close-up view. Add to this the hundreds of smaller private crafts, and you wonder how they don’t smash into each other.</p>\n<p>All around us, people are screaming at the top of their lungs, as if the object of their affection could actually hear them way out at sea. I wouldn’t be surprised if they could, such is the roar of the crowd.</p>\n<p>The shouting reached fever pitch as the first of the boats rounded the quay, finish line in sight. Given how long they’ve been racing the gap between them was astonishingly close. I’m not sure how they tell, but the first Gig to cross the finish line immediately started to celebrate. They must have been knackered, but somehow they found the strength to row the final few meters to Town Beach. Here, there’s a whole army of people to help them drag the Gig up onto the beach.</p>\n<p>(figure set:gigs,class:pull-both)</p>\n<p>Wanting to drink-in more of the atmosphere and a couple of the local ales, Katie and I headed to the Mermaid. This place is incredibly claustrophobic at the best of times, with memorabilia covering every inch of every available surface. Saturday evenings are particularly busy, but this was something else. We could see punters spilling out onto the pavement as we approached. The only way to get in was to forcibly push through the sweaty throng. I imagine as we introduced ourselves into the crush, two other people were ejected from another door somewhere. This place was full.</p>\n<p>Inside the beer was flowing. People were dancing on tables. Tall tales were being told of the day’s victories. Somehow we managed to get a seat, Katie on the end of a bench, and me perched awkwardly on a window ledge. What a night! We emerged several hours later, a little drunk and horse from trying to make ourselves heard.</p>\n<p>This is one of my favourite memories of the Islands. I felt totally immersed in the culture. Caught-up in something. It was a unique experience that I don’t think we could ever recapture. In a way, I wouldn’t want to. It was perfect, trying to get it back would somehow sully it.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Taking flight</h2>\n<p><em>In 2008, I took my first trip to the islands, and my first flight on a helicopter…</em></p>\n<p>There’s always a sadness that accompanies leaving the Isles of Scilly. It started for me this first year and has never diminished on subsequent trips. At least you used to be able to offset this with the excitement of a trip on the helicopter.</p>\n<p>After waving goodbye to our bags, which would be taken to the airport for us by Island Carriers, we headed into town. Now was the chance to buy as much <abbr title=\"Isles of Scilly\">IOS</abbr> branded tat as we could lay our grubby hands on. Of course, there was the Isles of Scilly tea towel; The Isles of Scilly fridge magnet; The Isles of Scilly puffin jigsaw; And the Isles of Scilly pencil and pencil sharpener deluxe set. Our friends and family were, understandably, delighted!</p>\n<p>Maxing-out your baggage allowance on a helicopter is surprisingly straightforward. We discovered this at check-in when both of our cases — now laden with souvenirs — were well over the 15 kg limit. Luckily the airport staff were as laid-back as every other islander we’d met, and waved us through.</p>\n<p>St.Mary’s Airport is by far the smallest terminal I’ve ever flown from. It’s miniature waiting area probably never any busier than it was now. A few people milled around, while others enjoyed hot drinks from styrofoam cups.</p>\n<p>When the time came, we were called into a small side room with the other passengers for our flight. Here, we were shown a short safety film from the late 80s. Then we heard it. A helicopter coming into land. The great throb-throb-throb of its propeller blades displacing the air.</p>\n<p>One of British International’s two <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikorsky_S-61\">Sikorsky S-61</a> helicopters landed with the slightest bounce. The side door flung open, and the passengers disembarked, ducking instinctively under the rotor blades.</p>\n<p>(figure set:helicopter,class:pull-both)</p>\n<p>Then it was our turn. Our air steward lead the way out onto the runway. We ducked under the rotors too, clinging desperately to lose items of clothing. Of course, we felt like rock stars.</p>\n<p>Once belts were fastened, the door was shut behind us with a reassuringly heavy click. Not that you can hear much above the roar of the engine, which now wound up ready for take-off. We felt an increase in the side-to-side wobble, and suddenly we were moving. The helicopter’s nose tipped forward and we swept up and along the runway. It’s exhilarating! The raw power that’s required to push this massive metal tube into the air must be immense. You feel every last joule of it.</p>\n<p>The view is spectacular. Passengers lucky enough to get window seats were furiously taking as many photos as they could. It’s too loud for conversation, so we just gesticulated to each other, pointing at things we recognised.</p>\n<p>Flying at 150 <abbr title=\"Miles Per Hour\">mph</abbr>, it only takes 20 minutes from St.Marys to Penzance. All too soon the islands disappeared over the horizon, and Lands End appeared in the port side windows. Moments later we were touching down at Penzance heliport.</p>\n<p>And that was that. Suddenly we were back to reality. Cars and people everywhere. Waiting for our bags, Katie asked me what I thought. She’d been extolling the virtues of Scilly since we’d met. “I’m in love”, I said. Or something like that. That’s the problem with memories, isn’t it? It’s sometimes hard to tell them apart from dreams.</p>\n"},{"title":"Some thoughts on design leadership","tags":["leading design conference","design","design leadership","barbican","conferences"],"date":"2017-10-30T00:00:00.000Z","filename":"67","content":"<p>I spent some of last week listening to some great design leaders share their thoughts at <a href=\"https://2017.leadingdesignconf.com/\">Leading Design 2017</a>. Hosted by the fine folks from <a href=\"https://clearleft.com/\">Clearleft</a> the event is now in its second year.</p>\n<p>Before last year’s event, I was still trying to figure out what my job was, let alone how to do it well. I think my biggest fear when I took the position was that I would no longer have much to offer. Increasingly I’d be taking on less and less of the day-to-day work, and without producing designs or churning out HTML what was I? Last year’s conference helped me to figure out at least some of what I should be doing with my days:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Designing team processes, environments and culture</li>\n<li>Protecting the team from too much work</li>\n<li>Evangelising design’s role in the company’s success</li>\n</ul>\n<p>My <a href=\"http://roobottom.com/articles/56/\">notes from last year</a> are a bit of a mess. This tells me that I hadn’t really fully understood what any of these new responsibilities were. In fact, its taken the last year for me to get a handle on what any of these mean for my working life. Was I doing a shitty job in the meantime? No, well, I certainly don’t think so. I just hadn’t fully appreciated that I’d taken the step out of a production role and into a leadership role and that I was completely unprepared for what that meant.</p>\n<p>The more I learn about design leadership, the more I realise that in most of the challenges you face every day, you can usually ditch the word <em>design</em>. Leadership is its own thing, a skill you have to be taught and then refine over time. Just because you can design doesn’t automatically mean you can lead a team of designers. Not something I was quick to pick up on. My advice for new design leaders is to realise that you’re unprepared for this new challenge and to cut yourself some slack when things inevitably go wrong.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>This year, I kept a page at the front of my notebook titled “Overall thoughts” and whenever I heard common themes that struck a chord, I wrote them down:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Things go wrong for everyone, no team is perfect, not even those with 100s of designs and huge budgets</li>\n<li>No-one in your company knows what design leadership is. Spend more time with other design leaders</li>\n<li>Be the “shit umbrella” — protect your team</li>\n<li>Managing designers is hard (although, I’d change this to managing people is hard)</li>\n<li>Strategic partnership is a must. Strive to understand how you can help others in your company solve problems by understanding their point of view</li>\n<li>Take the time to understand your business, not just the role of design within it</li>\n<li>Ask obvious questions, it’s a safe bet that your not the only one who doesn’t understand</li>\n</ul>\n<p>My thoughts on design leadership continue to evolve. I don’t think I’ll ever get to a point where I can write a comprehensive list of what makes a good Head of Design. Like anything, you get better at it over time. There’s always more to be learned, and always some way to be better at your job.</p>\n<p>I do think it’s important to keep evaluating and striving to be better. And, of course, events like Leading Design give you time to step back from the coalface and formulate your thoughts.</p>\n"},{"title":"Too much tuna: The current state of design tools","date":"2017-07-31T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["design","pattern libraries","design club"],"images":[{"image":"design-club-chapter-2.jpg","caption":"Listing the tuna, members of the Design Club taking part in the workshop","set":"tuna"}],"filename":"66","content":"<p>Last week I gave a short talk at <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Design-Club/\">Design Club</a> about what my team is currently doing with pattern libraries in Sketch.</p>\n<p>It was great to hear that people had lots of questions. Its obvious that were all thinking about patterns, and particularly how Sketch symbols have enabled a new workflow.</p>\n<p>Later, we moved on to a workshop session where we mapped out our design process and made a (long) list of all the tools we were currently using day-to-day.</p>\n<p>(figure set:tuna)</p>\n<p>What was clear is that there are a <em>lot</em> of design tools out there. Sketch is ubiquitous, having quickly proved its value against creaky Adobe tools. However, there’s a whole ecosystem of other tools that are designed to fill gaps in the designers workflow.</p>\n<p>Having both a design and front-end development background I feel like I’ve seen this all before. There have been several “revolutions” in web — <abbr title=\"Cascading Style Sheets\">CSS</abbr>, Responsiveness, HTMLinJS, etc —  that all gave rise to any number of tools that promised “more time doing what you love.”</p>\n<p>Some of these tools were flash in the pan: When they didn’t find traction amongst enough developers, they died. However, they each added their voices to the shared knowledge amongst developers on <em>how</em> to develop for the web.</p>\n<p>As it is now with design tools. Sure, some of them don’t really know what they’re trying to be, but can we blame them? We don’t know what we need right now. Ultimately what matters is the thinking behind patterns not how we build them.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, if you’re designing sites for the web or apps for devices, then eventually someone with a bit of coding nounce has to translate your designs into the real deal. Regardless of whether the ultimate destination of your design is HTML, Swift or <em>whatever</em>, I’d argue that designing with patterns in mind — no matter of the size of project — helps you think more like a developer. You’ll have better conversations with your developer friends and this will lead to a better experience for your users.</p>\n<p>Patterns is a way of thinking about design, rather than a set of tools. You could just as easily apply this thinking to MS Paint. But what the tools give us is a way to explore, as a community, what works best.</p>\n<p>I personally welcome the slew of tools even if they are pretty immature right now. There’s a really smart community of designers out there that’ll direct tool makers leading us all to a brighter future.

Designers have long had the idea of designing interfaces from a kit of pre-built parts, but never really had the tools to do this effectively. Sketch is such a tool.</p>\n<p>At Firefly, we’ve recently made the transition to Sketch specifically because of the power of symbols. These have enabled us to build our pattern library in a way that helps us to do some extremely rapid prototyping and create consistent experiences for our users.</p>\n<p>Our Front-End and iOS teams already have their own pattern libraries. These are different, partly due to technical reasons, but there’s another reason we kept the patterns separate. As we continue to strive for feature parity between platforms, its obvious that there are some fundamental differences between web and iOS.  There is a <em>way</em> of doing things in iOS — interactions that users expect — that’s different from the web. Hence, web and iOS have the same features, but implemented in the way that makes the most sense to users of that platform.</p>\n<p>Our dream was to create two design pattern libraries that would contain the same elements as the web and iOS libraries. This would mean that we’d all be working from the same list of patterns, rather than adding a translation step when it came to implementation.</p>\n<h2>Structure</h2>\n<p>We studied the structure of the existing pattern libraries and created a map that included all patterns, their modifiers and states. This gave us the structure for our patterns, and a place to start from when translating programatic patterns into something that would be useable in Sketch.</p>\n<p>In simple terms, our pattern library is a number of Sketch files containing — as symbols — all the elements in the Firefly interface. We divide these into separate files, one for each platform. We’ve also broken web into web-core and one file for each of our <a href=\"http://themes.fireflylearning.com\">four core themes</a>.</p>\n<p>In each of the files, we’ve categorised our symbols into areas. This helps massively with your mental model when browsing the symbols page. This also allows us to print a visual style-guide of all our patterns.</p>\n<p>(figure set:categorising,class:poke-both)</p>\n<h2>Symbols</h2>\n<p>Sketch supports symbol nesting and overrides. This makes symbols extremely powerful. This allows you to create a pattern element by combining symbols together.</p>\n<p>However, organisation is everything. If you don’t follow a systematic approach to creating patterns, they’re extremely difficult to use in the wild. We know from experience that confusion arises about which symbols are patterns, and which are simply the building blocks of patterns. Let me explain…</p>\n<h3>Parts and Patterns</h3>\n<p>(figure set:button-anatomy,class:pull-right)</p>\n<p>A pattern is made up of either parts or other symbols. Each part is a symbol. A Button, for example, is made up of two parts <em>Background</em> and <em>Label</em>, and another pattern <em>Icon</em>. We use <a href=\"https://www.sketchapp.com/learn/documentation/symbols/organizing-symbols/\">slash notation</a> to organise parts and patterns under one namespace.</p>\n<p>(figure set:dropdown,class:poke-both)</p>\n<p>Organising our symbols this way makes it easy when using a pattern. It’s immediately obvious from the list of symbols which is a pattern that’s intended for use, and which are just the building blocks of patterns.</p>\n<h3>Using Patterns in the wild</h3>\n<p>When designing a new feature, we’ll start out with a blank sketch file. Let’s say, for example, that we wanted a very simple interface that required two buttons: OK and Cancel. OK needs to be a cancel type with a tick icon, and Cancel needs to be a default type with a cross icon.</p>\n<p>In our pattern library file, we have a page called <em>scratch</em> where we can set up a pattern ready to be copied into another file. We select the <code>Button &gt; Patterns &gt; Button with Icon Left</code> symbol from the list and drop it into our scratch page. We can then use the symbol overrides to change it’s Background, Icon and Label as required. We can also override the text.</p>\n<p>(figure set:using-a-symbol,class:poke-both)</p>\n<p>Once the pattern is set up, we can then copy this into the new document. This only copies the parts required for this instance of the pattern. So trying to change the symbol overrides in the new file won’t work until you copy over all variations of a pattern.</p>\n<h2>Tips ’n tricks</h2>\n<p>There’s a few areas where symbols are ripe for improvement. Given Bohemian’s track record for updates and bug fixes I suspect these can’t be too far off. Meantime, there’s a couple of workarounds that we’ve found particularly useful that I’d like to share.</p>\n<h3>Pin to corner</h3>\n<p>The ability to change resize behaviour in symbols is extremely useful. However, the “Pin to corner” option is somewhat limited as it doesn’t let you specify <em>which</em> corner.</p>\n<p>(figure set:pintocorner,class:pull-right)</p>\n<p>We solve this by simply grouping a transparent shape in with the layer we wish to align. This allows you pin to other corners than the one that Sketch might have automatically picked for you.</p>\n<h3>Override colours of icons</h3>\n<p>It’s annoying to have to have separate symbols for different icon colours. Especially when adding a new colour, meaning you have to create a new symbol for all the icons in the new colour.</p>\n<p>Luckily, we can use layer masks and overrides to easily add colour options. An Icon pattern is actually a grouped rectangle masked out by the icon shape. We are then able to control the icon type <em>and</em> colour from a pre-defined pallet of colours. Adding a new colour is as easy as adding a new icon mask symbol.</p>\n<p>(figure set:overridecolour,class:poke-both)</p>\n<p>Another small tip: Make your icons and masks different sizes, that way you won’t get shown all the icons and colours together in the overrides dropdown.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Sharing patterns</h2>\n<p>So far I’ve not really touched on how we’re using our pattern library across a team. An essential part of any pattern library is its use beyond a single person. When we set out to create our pattern library, we had a simple set of requirements:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Symbols should be stored in a central location that is accessible by the whole team</li>\n<li>Symbols can be linked across files, updating a symbol in any file updates it everywhere</li>\n<li>Editing clashes are handled in a nice way</li>\n<li>Symbols can be organised into categories</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>What we’re currently doing</h3>\n<p>Initially we experimented with <a href=\"https://www.invisionapp.com/craft\">Craft</a> from inVision. It’s library functionality would allow us to store symbols in a central location, share them across the team. Most excitingly of all, symbols would be linked across files, meaning we could ensure we were always using the latest version in our designs.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, when it came to handling editing clashes, Craft did less well. We lost an entire week of work due to our library file becoming corrupted. We were told that this was a known issue, and the file was unrecoverable. We decided not to entrust our entire pattern library to Craft, there was no way we could risk that happening again.</p>\n<p>We switched to using Sketch files themselves to contain our patterns. A downside to this solution was that editing clashes weren’t handled, at all. Rather, whoever saved the file last would overwrite work of anyone else. Thankfully, <a href=\"https://abstractapp.com/\">Abstract</a> came to our rescue.</p>\n<p>The team has been using Abstract for version management of Sketch files for the last few weeks, and what a difference it’s made! Once you have the git mental model in your head, Abstract’s workflow makes a lot of sense. We can now branch off the master pattern library document, make our changes, and merge back. Clashes are handled visually, giving you the choice of which symbol definition to keep.</p>\n<p>(figure set:abstarct,class:poke-both)</p>\n<p>We now have three out of four of our original requirements. We’re almost there! But what about linking symbols across files?</p>\n<h2>A native solution?</h2>\n<p>I’d argue that level of complexity represented by shared symbols in Sketch requires a native solution. Plugins, like Craft, will only ever be a poly-fill at best.</p>\n<p>Looking at the features that Bohemian have added to Sketch over the last few versions, I strongly suspect that they’re already planning shared symbols. It’s a natural fit for them, they already have the cloud infrastructure from Sketch Cloud and with their new open JSON formatted files, it seems like this might be the next logical step.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Are you looking for a new design challenge in London?

She had a brilliant time! Here’s some of the things we liked:</p>\n<h2>Flying</h2>\n<p>In contrast to the last time we flew with <em>Roo</em>, this time we’d deliberately not booked flights which demanded us be at the airport at some ungodly hour. This meant that she wasn’t tired and therefore in a good mood.</p>\n<p>We were also a lot more prepared this time, we didn’t forget to bring her headphones or iPad pre-loaded with Peppa Pig.</p>\n<p>The weather on the way out made for an especially memorable flight over the Alps. I really love this picture of <em>Roo</em>, captivated by the view:</p>\n<p>(figure set:alps)</p>\n<h2>Our house</h2>\n<p>Our little home from home wasn’t so little! Being early in the season meant we picked up a bargain, and we’re able to stay in a massive country villa with amazing views. <em>Roo</em> especially loved the large fenced gardens, meaning she could tear around outside in relative safety. Being independent is increasingly important to her at the moment, so this was great.</p>\n<p>(figure set:house)</p>\n<h2>Pisa</h2>\n<p>Although she quite enjoyed having her picture taken holding up the leaning tower, Pisa isn’t the most relaxing place to visit with a small child. We spent a few hours here, but any more would’ve pushed <em>Roo</em> over the edge and into the canyon of tantrum.</p>\n<p>(figure set:leaningtower)</p>\n<p>One thing we <em>did</em> really like here was the Botanical Gardens. These we’re uncrowded and gave <em>Roo</em> ample room to run around amongst the beautiful flowers. If you find yourself in Pisa with a small child, seek them out. For only €4 an adult, they’re the perfect antidote to the crowds in the Square of Miracles.</p>\n<p>(figure set:gardens)</p>\n<h2>Lucca</h2>\n<p>Lucca is a fabulous place. We spent a couple of different days here, the first time just for a few hours to grab lunch and explore until the inevitable tiredness-time-bomb went off and a screaming child forced us home for tea.</p>\n<p>The second time, while my mum and dad went off to Florence, Katie, <em>Roo</em> and I spent a whole day here. We hired a side-by-side bicycle, which she <em>loved</em>, shouting “ciao” at passers-by.</p>\n<p>(figure set:bike)</p>\n<p>We had more pizza outside at a <a href=\"http://www.ristorantesancolombanolucca.it/en/\">lovely restaurant</a> where the staff we’re amazing with <em>Roo</em>, bringing her food out extremely quickly. This is mission critical, as I’m sure anyone with a hungry toddler in a public place will know.</p>\n<p>(figure set:lunch)</p>\n<p>After lunch, with <em>Roo</em> asleep in the push-chair, we explored the tiny winding streets. It was idilic in the afternoon sun. Katie went off to shop, and I took the opportunity to climb the recently restored <em>Torre Delle Ore</em>. The effort of climbing the 470 steps was rewarded at the top with an amazing view of the whole city and surrounding hills.</p>\n<p>(figure set:tower)</p>\n<p><em>Roo</em> woke up on the way back to the car, just as we were passing the merry go round. “I go on that?” she said. How could we refuse?</p>\n<p>(figure set:merrygoround)</p>\n<p>I’d highly recommend Lucca as an easy city to visit with a toddler. It had none of the crowds of Pisa, and felt an altogether more chilled out place.</p>\n<h2>In summary</h2>\n<p>We really hit the jackpot with both the location and weather for our week in northern Tuscany. There’s lot to enjoy for little people in this region if you’re prepared to miss out on some of the more famous places, and go where the crowds aren’t. We certainly had a brilliant time!</p>\n<p>(figure set:lastday)</p>\n"},{"title":"SOHN live at the Electric in Brixton","tags":["music"],"images":[{"image":"sohn-at-the-electric.jpg","caption":"SOHN, live at the Electric, 1st March 2017","set":"SOHN"}],"date":"2017-03-10T00:00:00.000Z","modifier":"dark","filename":"62","content":"<p>We’d been hankering to see <strong>SOHN</strong> for a while, ever since I’d played his first album, <em>Tremors</em>, almost to death last summer.

Thrashing out ideas with paper and pen is a great way of capturing early ideas quickly with the minimum of fuss. Together with user research, sketching is among the first steps we take whenever we’re designing a new feature.</p>\n<p>We’re also constantly refining our processes, always on the lookout for more efficient ways to build better software that allow our users to perform the tasks they find most useful.</p>\n<p>We’ve recently started using some ideas from a methodology called <strong>Design Sprints</strong>. Although its still early days, I wanted to share our experience of (what I’m calling) Firefly-flavoured Design Sprints.</p>\n<p>(figure set:squad)</p>\n<h2>What is a design sprint?</h2>\n<p>The design sprint was developed by Jake Knapp from <a href=\"http://www.gv.com/sprint/\">Google Ventures</a>. In its full form, its a five day process for answering business questions through design. Its a way to fail early meaning you, <em>theoretically</em>, deliver something that works first time.</p>\n<p>Implicit in the process is the requirement to gather opinions from all areas of the business, not just the design team. Typically you might involve those with customer contact, for example the support or client-experience teams. You may also invite an expert from finance and marketing as well as members from the tech and design teams.</p>\n<p>A plan for the week might look like this:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr><th>Day</th><th>Outline</th></tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td>Monday</td><td>Understanding the challenge and decide what problem you’re trying to solve</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Tuesday</td><td>A number of different sketching activities to fully explore potential solutions</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Wednesday</td><td>The whole team presents and votes on solutions from Tuesday.</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Thursday</td><td>Creating a prototype of a chosen solution.</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Friday</td><td>Testing your prototype with real users and gathering feedback.</td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>What’s the benefit for Firefly?</h2>\n<p>We’ve been getting excited about Design Sprints for a while. The mantra of “fail early” is especially useful as it helps us to stay agile in a fast-paced market place.</p>\n<p>We’ve always listened closely to what teachers, students and parents want, but understanding exactly what they’ll find genuinely useful is rather more difficult.</p>\n<p>A process like Design Sprints helps us get our ideas in-front of customers at the earliest possible opportunity, and find out if what we <em>think</em> they want is actually useful, without going through the long process of design, build and QA first.</p>\n<h2>Our experience</h2>\n<p>We already had a very well defined problem, namely how to give schools greater flexibility in their Firefly navigation. In the sprint we’d set out to design both the updated navigation and the administration interface that would allow site administrators to customise the menu.</p>\n<p>I ran the day, as the “facilitator”. Viviana, our product manager, was the “decider”. The Communications squad (a cross-discipline team who would be building the feature) were our sketching team.</p>\n<p>We used a number of the activities from the Design Sprints book, together with a mix of activities from elsewhere that we thought would enable us to solve this problem in a day.</p>\n<h3>Jobs to be done</h3>\n<p>Before the sprint, Viv created a list of <strong>jobs to be done</strong>. Based directly from feedback, these are a way to think about tasks that users want to achieve. They’re written in a way so as the focus is on the task rather than a particular technology or solution, an example of this might be:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When organising the school’s Firefly pages, I want to be able to divide pages into highly visible sections, so I can make it easier to find content that is relevant for students, parents and teachers and show off the content we have.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Sketching</h3>\n<p>We went through a number of sketching exercises, first creating quick low fidelity sketches to flesh-out some early ideas. Then we moved on to creating more detailed sketches that detailed a whole user journey.</p>\n<p>(figure set:sketching)</p>\n<h3>Arriving at a solution</h3>\n<p>After each of the team had taken it in turns to present their sketch, we moved onto a round of <strong>heat mapping</strong>. Everyone was given a set of 10 sticky dots and we’re told to stick one or two next to features they particularly liked from the sketches. In this way, standout features were highlighted by clusters of dots.</p>\n<p>(figure set:voting)</p>\n<p>Viv then lead a round of Q&amp;A where we’d discuss the standout features. As the decider, she then made the call on which features would progress to design stage. I noted these down as a set of requirements.</p>\n<p>Finally, we created a final set of sketches as a team (with one person designated as the “scribe”) that combined all the features into a coherent user journey.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>This type of small, well-defined problem <em>is</em> solvable in a day. What we didn’t do is square the circle, i.e., test our solution with users. That’s a definite problem. We plan on creating interactive prototypes during the design stage which we’ll test with teachers.</p>\n<p>I predict this won’t turn-up too many surprises as we’ve not deviated too far from an established pattern. But this is definitely worth thinking about earlier for more complex problems or brand-new features.</p>\n<p>On a practical level we were also able to refine the “short-sprint” process for the next time: Chopping out the bits that didn’t yield anything useful and providing better explanations around the bits that confused people.</p>\n<p>We would’ve also liked to invite some guest experts from other areas of the business, we’ll definitely do this next time.</p>\n<h2>Where next?</h2>\n<p>Finding a balance between the full methodology as set out in the book, and a process we can use many times in quick succession is tricky. Cherry-picking <em>is</em> something the book suggests: You can remove day five, and do testing as a separate process without the need for the whole team. However, we deconstructed the sprint to its bare-bones, and I’m not convinced we didn’t loose… <em>something</em>.</p>\n<p>But, Firefly-flavoured Design Sprints are definitely here to stay. We’ve already booked-in longer sprints to help us solve slightly bigger problems, and allow us to include more of the methodology. We’ll refine them over time, cherry-picking the bits that work best for us.</p>\n<p>The culture of fail-early is one that we’re committed to. At the heart of this is getting features into the hands of clients as early as possible, listening to their feedback, and quickly delivering the next iteration. Design Sprints are just one way of doing this.</p>\n"},{"title":"The road to Firefly 6, part 2","date":"2017-01-23T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["Firefly","design"],"images":[{"image":"anna-and-danielle.jpg","caption":"Anna and Danielle discuss the relative merits of button patterns in the old Firefly office, October 2015","set":"anna"},{"image":"markbook.jpg","caption":"The Firefly Markbook, showing some example data from our training class.","set":"markbook"}],"filename":"60","content":"<p>This is part two of a two part article all about building Firefly 6 and the lessons we learned along the way.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"/articles/59\">part one</a> we took whistle stop tour of the year-and-a-half it took to design and build Firefly 6. This time I’m going to talk about some the front-end technology and practices we used to help us build more robust software.</p>\n<h2>We built a pattern library</h2>\n<p>Until Firefly 6, it was usual practice to build features one-by-one. There was little re-use of code, meaning if we found a bug with an element, then we’d have to fix it multiple times.</p>\n<p>What we needed was a pattern library! In October we were joined for a few days by Anna Debenham who literally wrote the book on <a href=\"http://www.maban.co.uk/projects/front-end-style-guides/\">front-end style guides</a> to help us catalogue Firefly’s user interface.</p>\n<p>(figure set:anna)</p>\n<p>We used this to build a “single source of truth” library of interface elements. This means that Firefly is now essentially built from a kit of parts. If we need a button, we can just call one in from the library. Even better, if we find a bug with the button, we can fix it once, and its fixed everywhere. Much faster and a lot more robust.</p>\n<p>I also have to mention <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniellehuntrods/\">Danielle Huntrods</a>, a contractor who worked with us for almost a year, during which she built the majority of the of the pattern library. It was her brilliance that gave us such a solid foundation for the future.</p>\n<p>We plan (at some point) to release a publicly accessible version of the pattern library. This is part of our ongoing commitment to openness and giving back to the web community. Hopefully others will find what we’ve done useful.</p>\n<h2>We flattened the cascade</h2>\n<p>Cascading Style Sheets, or CSS, is the language that allows us to define the visual appearance of web pages. Firefly uses quite a lot of it.</p>\n<p>CSS uses something called a “Cascade”, meaning that elements can inherit their style from other elements that use the same HTML. For example:</p>\n<pre><code>button {\n    background-color: blue;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Means all <code>button</code> elements on the page would have a blue background.</p>\n<p>However if you wanted to make one red, you can give it a name, and use that name in the CSS to override the background colour to red. Useful and straightforward enough.</p>\n<p>However, The problem with this comes when you have thousands of elements. Sometimes, when you style one element, because of the way CSS cascades, you inadvertently style another element you didn’t mean to.</p>\n<p>We solve this at Firefly by using a way of writing CSS called BEM, or Block Element Modifier. This allows us to effectively remove the cascade by using a naming system that guarantees that  you only ever style the specific element you meant to.</p>\n<p>This is great for us at Firefly, as it means we ship far less styling bugs. And it makes it easy for us to fix those bugs that do slip through, knowing that we’re not going to accidentally  cause more bugs elsewhere.</p>\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/\">read more about BEM here</a>, on the excellent CSS Tricks website.</p>\n<h2>We became more Reactive</h2>\n<p>Firefly makes heavy use of the other great language of the web: Javascript. This is the technology that allows us to manipulate the interface in real-time, without having to reload the page every time you take any action within Firefly.</p>\n<p>To help us write better Javascript, we’ve stared using a library called <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/react/\">React</a>. React was developed by Facebook to solve some of the challenges they were facing when building their website.</p>\n<p>To understand why this is good for Firefly, lets look at a practical example of a feature we introduced in Firefly 5: The Markbook.</p>\n<p>The Markbook is a highly interactive screen with lots of different states. We use Javascript to manage these states. However, this is where things get complicated very quickly. The developer must remember to update <em>all</em> the states when the user interacts with <em>any</em> of the states.</p>\n<p>For example, opening one popup will need to close any others. As you add more and more states, this compounds the problem. This is the source of many bugs, as developers can’t keep all these things in their heads all at once.</p>\n<p>(figure set:markbook)</p>\n<p>React manages states for you, by keeping its own internal copy of the page’s HTML, (what’s known as the Document Object Model, or DOM). It continually compares <em>its</em> model  to the real DOM that’s shown to the user, and updates it on the fly.</p>\n<p>In this way, things like closing one popup when another is opening can be controlled by one simple rule, and React handles the rest. This is leads to less bugs and happier users.</p>\n<p>We make use of React in the new Task Details screen, where teachers can mark student’s work in a variety of ways. This screen has hundreds of different states, all managed reliably by React.</p>\n<h2>We simplified our themes offering</h2>\n<p>This was perhaps the most controversial changes we made with made in Firefly 6. We did this to improve the user experience of the majority of users in Firefly, but quite understandably some schools were disgruntled when they discovered that we were retiring Columnist and Angular. We were also removed support for a number of custom themes we’d built for some of our long-standing clients.</p>\n<h3>Fewer bugs</h3>\n<p>Themes have always been the source of front-end bugs within Firefly. Each theme has its own HTML with which it “wraps” standard Firefly elements (like resource page content, or the Markbook for example). It also has its own CSS with which it will restyle the standard Firefly elements.</p>\n<p>This means that when we release new feature or updates existing ones, we also have to update the themes. The more themes, the more updates we have to do. Obviously, this model doesn’t scale well. So we’ve reduced the number of themes we offer to ensure that when we release updates, we can ensure that all our schools have a great experience.</p>\n<h3>Theme Variables</h3>\n<p>What about theme customisation? Many schools want to inject their personality into the tools they use every day. In Firefly 5 we introduced <strong>Theme Variables</strong> to do just this. We improved them in Firefly 6 (more about that later), but its worth covering the basics:</p>\n<p>Firefly uses a CSS pre-processor called <em><a href=\"http://lesscss.org/\">Less</a></em>. This allows us to store colours as variables, and manipulate them programatically. For example, Melody has a variable called <code>@background-colour</code>, thats used in different places throughout the interface. <em>Less</em> allows you to use an array of <a href=\"http://lesscss.org/functions/#color-operations\">colour operation functions</a> to do things like darken or lighten colours. This is particularly useful for creating a harmonious colour scheme.</p>\n<p>We also use <em>Less</em> to check the relative contrast between two colours. For example, lets say we have a box, styled like this:</p>\n<pre><code>.box {\n    background-colour: @background-colour;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>We’d want to check that any text that’s put inside that box is legible. We can do this with <em>Less</em> by checking the contrast of two alternative colours <em>against</em> a background colour, and using the one which is most legible, like so:</p>\n<pre><code>.box {\n    background-colour: @background-colour;\n    color: contrast(@background-colour, black, white);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>All of which means that, per school, we can override these core variables with school colours, and be assured that the interface will still look great, and all text will be legible.</p>\n<h3>Better theme options</h3>\n<p>We’ve done a lot of work in Firefly 6 to improve and streamline the Theme Variables. Each theme now only requires a small set of colours. Every other colour used within the interface is based-off this core set.</p>\n<p>We’ve also removed a number of theme options that weren’t really adding much value for schools. For instance, lots of schools told us that they didn’t really care about things like background patterns, or changing fonts. We now use smart defaults instead.</p>\n<p>We’ve paved the way to style more of the interface based-off the schools’ colour choices in the future, all in a way that will work with feature updates we make.</p>\n<h2>Wrapping up</h2>\n<p>I hope you’ve found these couple of articles interesting. We like to be as open as possible about the way we build software.

We learned a lot about <em>how</em> to build great software in this time, so I’ll talk about that at the end.</p>\n<p>In part two (spoiler alert) I’ll talk about the changes we made to our technology stack and our design and front-end development teams.</p>\n<h2>Spring/Summer 2015</h2>\n<p>Back in April 2015 we knew <em>roughly</em> what teachers, students and parents wanted from the next version of Firefly. However, there was still lots of work to do to refine our ideas into a definite, focused list of features that would work for everyone.</p>\n<p>As Head of Product, Viv ran a number of discovery workshops with teachers, students and parents from a large number of our schools. Armed with this research, our UX team was able to start sketching solutions from which we could create interactive product mock-ups. These were then tested with more users, refined, and tested again.</p>\n<p>(figure set:testing)</p>\n<p>We didn’t just limit this discovery phase to the start of the project, we continued to conduct user research at every stage. We’re lucky that our clients don’t mind acting as guinea pigs and let us test all our crazy new ideas on them. We also engaged an agency to connect with non-client teachers, students and parents, to ensure that the new features would work for everyone, not just those used to Firefly already.</p>\n<h2>Autumn/Winter 2015</h2>\n<p>While research and design were progressing nicely, thoughts turned to a busy conference season. With the Firefly Learning Conference just around the corner and Bett looming, we knew we needed something more tangible than interactive mock-ups to show people.</p>\n<p>Bett, in particular, would be the first time clients and prospects alike could get hands-on with the new Firefly. We had to build a demo version of Firefly that would work well enough to give prospective clients a taste of what was to come in Firefly 6, that would also be robust enough to work with the WiFi in the ExCel centre.</p>\n<p>In a sterling effort by all involved, we cut a demo-ready version of Firefly less than 24 hours before the start of the show. Despite there being a few bits of hidden sticky-tape and string holding everything together, we had an amazingly successful Bett. The demo stood up to anyting our stand visitors threw at it, and I think its fair to say that everyone was suitably wowed.</p>\n<h2>Spring/Summer 2016</h2>\n<p>At the Firefly Learning Conference in November we’d confidently told our clients that they could expect Firefly 6 in the summer term. By the spring it was apparent that we couldn’t meet this deadline and release a version of Firefly that was of sufficient quality. So we took the difficult decision to delay the release to the next logical point where schools would have a chance to install it in-between terms: Christmas.</p>\n<p>In the summer we we’re able to release the new navigation, and because it was now in the hands of schools quickly iterate it based on feedback from a large group of users. As with all changes, it was met with a mixed reception, but the vast majority of users loved the changes we’d made.</p>\n<h2>Autumn/Winter 2016</h2>\n<p>We were now nearing the end of our development phase. A significant portion of both the web app and native iOS and Android apps had now been completed. We were on target for our completion date of 28th November, which would give us 2 weeks to do final testing before launch on 12th December.</p>\n<p>Building software is hard; Building great software is very hard. So it was understandable that the final few weeks before our production deadline was filled with late nights and many take-outs in the office.</p>\n<p>It is a testament to the diligent work of everyone involved that we brought this incredible new version in on time. Not just the team who built the software, but also the support, client experience, sales and marketing teams. They’re all responsible in equal part for Firefly 6.</p>\n<p>(figure set:team,class:span-both)</p>\n<h2>Please release me, let me go</h2>\n<p>Even the most old school software companies release their software more often than every 18 months, so why did we take a year-and-a-half to release Firefly 6?</p>\n<p>Well, the reality is that we were releasing, every two weeks in fact. We shipped <strong>35</strong> versions from <code>5.2.1</code> in April 2015 to <code>6.0.1</code> on 12th December 2016. These releases included a large number of bug fixes, and lots of new features and tweaks to existing features.</p>\n<p>So why was 6 such a big release? Well, this was such a step change that there were several Epics that wouldn’t make sense in isolation. For example, the new <em>Set A Task</em> flow allows teachers to create rich tasks with far more flexibility than tasks they could create in Firefly 5. Releasing this without any ability for students to respond to these tasks, or teachers then to mark the response was simply unfeasible.</p>\n<h2>Things we learned and changes we made</h2>\n<p>We’ve certainly have learned a thing or two along the way, not least that we need more development resource, but having just landing the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/15/firefly-takes-5-6m-series-a-for-its-learning-support-platform-for-schools/\">largest Series A investment</a> in Education Technology in the UK, we’re certainly now in a position to do that.</p>\n<p>It wouldn’t have been possible to build such complex software with a relatively small team without some smart ways of working. Over the last year-and-a-half we’ve made some big changes to the way we work, these help us work faster and release less bugs.</p>\n<h3>We established Epics, Squads and Guilds</h3>\n<p>We spilt sets of features up into logic chunks. These, we call <strong>Epics</strong>. An Epic is a set of features that makes sense end-to-end. For example, the new task setting flow was a single Epic. This included all the backend logic, and user interface elements for teachers, parents and students.</p>\n<p>Each Epic is owned by team called a <strong>Squad</strong>. A Squad is a self contained unit of UX’ers, Designers, Developers and a manager. Everyone who’s needed to research, design, build, refine and manage workflow for that one Epic.</p>\n<p>There are parts of the product that are relevant to more than one Squad. For example, the Pattern Library is used by all squads working on the Firefly web interface. To manage changes and updates to these areas we have <strong>Guilds</strong>. Typically a Guild will contain a representative from each Squad, and meet on an ad-hoc basis when changes are needed.</p>\n<h3>We moved</h3>\n<p>It would be remiss of me not to mention our new office. In October we moved from Lyric Square to the Aircraft Factory, in Hammersmith. We now have an amazing space that feels far more attuned to building brilliant software. We even have Joe’s old Raleigh Firefly bike (the inspiration for the name) in pride of place above his desk.</p>\n<p>(figure set:office)</p>\n<h3>We established the Nine Rules</h3>\n<p>I think what we’ve learned can be distilled into a set of principles that we’ve refined throughout this project. These are <strong>Firefly’s Nine Rules:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Frequent tasks should be easy and occasional tasks achievable</strong>. Teachers are incredibly busy, don’t give them a vast array of options.</li>\n<li><strong>Use smart defaults.</strong> We make good choices, so users don’t have to.</li>\n<li><strong>Don’t make me think.</strong> Make the next action obvious and unambiguous. Reduce unnecessary choices.</li>\n<li><strong>Beautiful by default.</strong> Teachers want to be proud of the things they create, so make this easy for them,</li>\n<li><strong>Optimise.</strong> Firefly should be fast.</li>\n<li><strong>Do less.</strong> Firefly should do a core set of things extremely well.</li>\n<li><strong>Design for teaching, not content management.</strong> Firefly isn’t a content management system, its a learning tool.</li>\n<li><strong>Right feature at the right moment.</strong> Too many options are confusing, be smart about when we expose a new feature.</li>\n<li><strong>Firefly isn’t just used in school</strong> Users should be able to achieve their task, no matter their location.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Where next?</h3>\n<p>Its an exciting time for Firefly. We’re expanding our team, and we’re brimming with ideas for the future. We’re working closely with a wide array of our clients to shape the next iteration of Firefly. There won’t be a large release for a while, but that’s exciting in itself, it means we’re going to work on smaller features that we can get into your hands quicker. I, for one, can’t wait to see what the next eighteen months brings.</p>\n"},{"title":"I made some Christmas cards","date":"2016-12-14T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["drawing"],"images":[{"image":"christmas-cards-2016.jpg","caption":"Some Christmas cards, wot I made","set":"cards"}],"filename":"58","content":"<p>(figure set:cards,class:pull-both)</p>\n<p>I tried my hand at watercolour and created some Christmas cards.

It was great! It had a gated pool, and all the toys the child could ever want. It was also close to beaches, restaurants and interesting places to visit.</p>\n<p>The weather was a bit of a mixed bag, we had a few nice days, but if you like it hot (Like I do) then mid-October isn’t really the time to visit Portugal. It certainly wasn’t warm enough to heat the solar-powered pool heater. I went in a few times, but it was too cold for Katie and <em>Roo</em>.</p>\n<h2>Striking a balance</h2>\n<p>Every now and again I have a moment where it dawns on me that we have a child now, and our lives will never be the same again. Our first family holiday was one of those moments. Gone were the late night meals-out and morning lay-ins of holidays gone by. We could no longer plan days out that consisted purely of thing that Katie and I wanted to do. We had a little head to consider.</p>\n<h2>Things we liked</h2>\n<p>I think we managed to strike a balance, and found activities that we all enjoyed. <em>Roo</em> (for the most part) was happy to go with the flow, and enjoyed exploring new places.</p>\n<p>Here’s some of the things we liked in and around Caldas da Rainha.</p>\n<h3>Food</h3>\n<p>The Portuguese all seemed to love children, so made eating out at lunch extremely easy. There were excellent restaurants almost  everywhere we went, but a personal favourite was the vegetarian restaurant <a href=\"http://maratona.tv/\">Maratona</a> in the centre of Caldas. They were brilliant with <em>Roo</em>, rushing through an order of chips to prevent the inevitable mealtime meltdown.</p>\n<p>(figure set:maratona)</p>\n<h3>Exploring</h3>\n<p>We were delighted to find that <em>Roo</em> didn’t mind mooching around villages and towns. She was fascinated by the shops full of (mainly tile-based) gifts. As long as she was fed and could enjoy the occasional ice cream she was happy.</p>\n<p>The monastery at Albobaça was a particular favourite, with it’s large stone rooms. She loved hearing her footsteps and voice echoing down the corridors, <em>“echo, Mummy!”</em></p>\n<p>(figure set:monastery,class:span-both)</p>\n<p>We also really liked \u000fÓbidos, a fortified city that dates back to the 13th century. She loved the shops, castle and ice cream. We loved exploring the castle walls, the wonderful weather and the local cherry liqueur that you drink from a chocolate cup.</p>\n<h3>Lisbon Oceanarium</h3>\n<p>She <em>loved</em> the Oceanarium in Lisbon. We did have to queue a little for tickets (top tip: book online before you go) but the efficient staff meant our wait was fairly short.</p>\n<p>I would love to know what she was thinking as she stared up at the double-floor height tank full, packed to the <em>gills</em> with all kind of fish. Its difficult to know what goes through that little head, but she chatted about <em>“fsh”</em> all the way back to the Villa.</p>\n<p>(figure set:oceanarium)</p>\n<h3>Buddha Eden</h3>\n<p>The Buddha Eden in Bombarral is an amazing place. Set in 30 acres of beautiful gardens are hundreds of sculptures from all over Asia. <em>Roo</em> loved the wide open spaces and all the huge sculptures. There’s also some well times cafés where we were able to refuel while <em>Roo</em> had a sleep in her push-chair.</p>\n<p>(figure set:buddha)</p>\n<h3>Beaches, parks and gardens</h3>\n<p>Besides all the things we paid money for, there were plenty of free things that we enjoyed too. There is a beautiful park in Caldas that was a big hit with <em>Roo</em>, full of amazing green spaces, a lovely play-park and a couple of nice cafés.</p>\n<p>There’s also some really great beaches in this area, which were deserted when we visited, it being so late in the year. The sea was freezing, but that didn’t stop <em>Roo</em> enjoying a paddle.</p>\n<p>(figure set:park)</p>\n<h2>Things we didn’t like as much</h2>\n<p>The flight home was a bit rubbish. We’d stayed in a hotel at the airport the night before, but hadn’t really thought through the night sharing a room with <em>Roo</em>. So, between a disturbed night in a strange room and the 4:30am start to get our early flight its fair to say that <em>Roo</em> wasn’t in the best of moods.</p>\n<p>Halfway home, in order to placate our struggling child, Katie had taken her on a walk down the isle to visit the cabin crew. While there she decided to vomit over the side of the plane and several unsuspecting passengers. Tiredness had gotten the better of her.</p>\n<h2>In summary</h2>\n<p>We had a brilliant time in Portugal, we’d thoroughly recommend it as a holiday destination with a small child. It was different, for sure, but I think we made it work, and made some more happy memories with the <em>Roo</em>.</p>\n"},{"title":"Common threads from Leading Design Conference 2016","date":"2016-10-26T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["design","conferences"],"filename":"56","content":"<p>I’ve just spent three days at the Barbican enjoying the inaugural Leading Design Conference. Having being promoted the role of Head of Design fairly recently, I found the vast majority of the talks and both workshops extremely poignant.</p>\n<p>This was also the sense I got from my fellow attendees. Chatting with people over lunch, or a beer later on, I was struck by just how many “Yeah, me too!” moments we had. It turns out that leading design is hard, but I’m reassured to know that people have the same problems as me.</p>\n<p>I was further reassured at the common themes that emerged over the event. It means we’re all on similar pages (or, at least we’re all reading the same book), and in an attempt to sift through those bits of knowledge that really spoke to me, here’s my top (sometimes badly paraphrased) common threads from the last three days. This is far-from all the messages that spoke to me, but this is the stuff that will have most immediate impact on my work:</p>\n<h2>Designing design</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://scottberkun.com/\">Scott Berkun</a>’s talk <em>Design vs. The World</em> started the conference on the right note with a big picture view of what it means to do design in the real world, and how it isn’t just pushing pixels around a screen. It got me thinking about my role, and how its increasingly solving problems that aren’t related to UI design, or writing CSS.</p>\n<p>Later, during the Q&amp;A session with <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/aboutthebbc/insidethebbc/managementstructure/biographies/whitney_julia/\">Julia Whitney</a> (BBC), <a href=\"http://www.dannyhearn.me/\">Danny Hearn</a> and <a href=\"https://www.markboulton.co.uk/\">Mark Boulton</a> (Monotype), it was said (with perhaps a hint of lamentation) that we’re no longer doing design at the coal-face, rather it’s our job to design the design experience: The environments and culture in which our teams works, and the processes they lean-on to get their work done.</p>\n<p>This really struck a chord with me.</p>\n<h2>Resistance is futile</h2>\n<p>Someone (I’m sorry I can’t remember who) included a slide of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borg_(Star_Trek)\">Locutus of Borg</a>, simultaneously making the point about assimilating into other team’s cultures, and scoring points with me for a Star Trek reference.</p>\n<p>In her talk <em>New on the Job: Your First 90 Days in a Design Leadership Role</em> <a href=\"http://pnts.us/\">Andrea Mignolo</a> talked about the “layer cake”, a delicious way to visualise the hierarchy in your company. She argued that you had to design the experience for each layer, to talk about design in the language of your audience.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/@ccourage\">Catherine Courage</a> said “Strive for shared empathy”, the points in the middle where you can meet and talk design in a way thats understandable by even the most numbers-driven business development manager.</p>\n<p>In both her talk and brilliant workshop <a href=\"http://www.practicallyux.com/\">Gail Swanson</a> taught us about presenting to decision makers. We used mapping techniques to better understand the drivers for those people from whom we seek approval. This is definitely a technique I’ll try at Firefly, to be able to frame an argument in a way that already fits in with the pressures and  priorities of others is incredibly powerful.</p>\n<h2>Dark matter</h2>\n<p>How do we quantify the value of design? Its difficult to ask quantitative questions when you’re dealing with solving problems on an emotional level. How would you measure a target like “Users feel 9% more engaged this quarter”? We don’t have the tools to measure qualitative data like this. And yet, this is the stuff that really adds value.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://nathan.com/\">Nathan Shedroff</a>’s talk <em>Using the Waveline: Mapping Premium Value to the User Journey (a new tool for planning deeper customer experiences)</em> detailed how to start to measure the emotional impact over time that your product or service has, and how this can be designed for maximum empathy.</p>\n<p>If you’re at all involved in designing anything for anyone (I would argue that’s everyone), then I’d recommend further reading into Nathan’s Waveline theories. It’s certainly something I’ll investigate further.</p>\n<h2>A quick note on the conference itself</h2>\n<p>Leading Design was perhaps the most useful, insightful and timely conference I’ve ever attended. Huge thanks to <a href=\"http://clearleft.com/is/andy-budd\">Andy Budd</a> et al for doing such a great job, and spotting the need for this event. You asked if we wanted another in 2017, its a resounding “yes” from me.</p>\n<p>The last thing I want to mention was the venue. I jumped a the chance for a tour of the Barbican during the lunch break the second day. If you’re a fan of brutalist architecture then this site is must-see. It was the perfect venue for a fantastic three days of conference.</p>\n"},{"title":"We need to talk about Europe","date":"2016-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["politics"],"images":[{"image":"we-need-to-talk-about-europe.jpg","caption":"A badly drawn EU flag, in tatters","set":"default"}],"filename":"55","content":"<p>Like many of my friends, I was shocked by the results of last weeks referendum about Britain’s future in Europe. I spent the majority of the last week feeling angry, let down and increasingly lied-to, as more revelations about the leave campaign’s plan, or lack of it, came to light. But, there’s a kind of catharsis in writing, so I’ve decided to recount some of my thoughts about Brexit here, uninformed as they may be.</p>\n<p>(figure set:default)</p>\n<p>When I went to bed on Thursday night, Gibraltar had just voted overwhelmingly to remain. No surprises there. My wife Katie, and our daughter, were away for a couple of nights and I’d decided to get an early night without the possibility of being woken by a little voice in the night. When my alarm woke me at six-thirty, I immediately checked my phone. I couldn’t believe it. How could this have happened?</p>\n<p>But why should I feel so angry, when only a few weeks ago I couldn’t make up my mind which way to vote? When the referendum was first announced, I’d just assumed I’d vote to remain. I suppose I’m of that generation that doesn’t have a concept of the empire, or Britain being great. I’ve lived all my life in a country who’s best days were supposedly behind it. So being part of Europe, being part of that culture, history and having hope for a united future is incredibly attractive.</p>\n<p>But then I listened to the arguments to leave: That we’d be better off by electing our own law-makers; That we’d save £350million a week; That the European Union is on the verge of collapse anyway, and I started to doubt my convictions.</p>\n<p>It was only when I started to <em>really</em> think about these claims, and read a little deeper into them did I decide that my gut instincts were right: The EU may be far from perfect, but if these were the sort of lies the leave campaign had to employ in order to persuade me, then, on balance, we’d be better off remaining. In other ways too, staying part of Europe, having a seat at the negotiating table, felt like the better choice to me. I wanted our future to be open, not closed off.</p>\n<h2>Brexit fallout</h2>\n<p>The Brexit fallout was swift. Our policy makers quickly fell into old patterns of in-party fighting and back-stabbing. No one has yet really set out a plan for what we do next beyond a few platitudes designed to reassure, but ultimately saying nothing. I have a horrible feeling that both main parties haven’t a clue what to do next. Even worse still, there seems to be something rotten at the heart of the Conservative party that is yet to come to light. What is clear, though, is that the old party divisions don’t work any more.</p>\n<p>The country is divided: “We are the 48%” chant those marching on London in protest at what was ultimately a fair democratic result. “Cry babies” comes the reply from the leave camp. It’s a mess. Darkest of all is the actions of a few who think this result means that half the country just gave them carte blanche to air their bullshit racist rhetoric.</p>\n<p>Beyond our borders, it seems that exiting the EU will have little to no effect on migrants entering Britain. And why would it? We’re completely reliant on foreign works to shore-up our essential services. What our exit does is send the wrong message of &quot;You’re not welcome here&quot;. It remains to be seen how this will play out, but we may have just alienated a large group of people we rely upon every day.</p>\n<h2>Liar, liar</h2>\n<p>Perhaps the hardest pill for those on both sides of the debate was the way in which our exit was won. It’s abundantly clear that many politicians aren’t above telling bold-faced lies in order to secure a result.</p>\n<p>This, for me, is the most unbelievable fact of UK politics. How can it be right for those we’re supposed to trust with governing our lives to openly lie to us? Perhaps I’m misunderstanding the situation, but this seems completely crazy.</p>\n<h2>Where now?</h2>\n<p>This whole sorry affair has highlighted some home truths: I’ve never been particularly interested in politics. I never know the policies of those standing in local elections, I just vote based on some loose affiliation with the party my parents support. This is, admittedly, totally unacceptable.</p>\n<p>Talking with friends, I was not surprised that many of them feel the same way. I don’t think it’s totally our fault though. The main parties in this country often say roughly the same things. It seems they have old policies that seek to fulfil the goals of the party 30 years ago, but are irrelevant today. No wonder its hard to choose between them.</p>\n<p>For my part, and for many friends, Brexit came as a shock. I’m hoping we can use it for positive change in the way we approach those that would seek public office — and our role in electing them. I’m striving to become more informed, and with information comes power to make the right choices for a better future for Britain.</p>\n"},{"date":"2015-11-12T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Firefly Learning Conference 2015","images":[{"image":"conference-2015-cover.jpg","caption":"Simon, at the Firefly Learning Conference 2015"},{"image":"conference-2015-josh-01.jpg","caption":"Some of Josh’s cartoons generating quite a lot of interest","set":"josh","width":3289,"height":2642},{"image":"conference-2015-josh-02.jpg","caption":"Badger, badger, badger (mushroom, mushroom)","set":"josh","width":3184,"height":2388},{"image":"conference-2015-team-01.jpg","caption":"Teachers receive a warm welcome from Team Firefly","set":"team"},{"image":"conference-2015-team-02.jpg","caption":"Abi and David","set":"team"},{"image":"conference-2015-team-03.jpg","caption":"Fireflies queue for lunch","set":"team"}],"tags":["conferences","firefly"],"filename":"54","content":"<p>Aside from <a href=\"http://www.bettshow.com/\">The Bett Show</a>, the Firefly Learning Conference is our biggest UK event of the year.

We’ve really built on that move this year; With an expanded product team and a huge push to make user experience a core part of how we build software. My team, Design, have been instrumental in the development of Firefly 6. We now sit as part of the product team, and along side Development and UX we’ve undertaken the design of four new iOS apps and the design and front-end build of Firefly on the web.</p>\n<p>Over the last few months we’ve updated almost all our processes, right from the way we’ve massively increased the amount of research we do with teachers, students and parents; to creating a pattern library for all our front-end code.</p>\n<p>I’ve <a href=\"/articles/46/\">said it before</a>, but it bares repeating: I’m incredibly proud of all we’ve achieved this year, and can’t wait to get Firefly 6 into the hands of our teachers and their students.</p>\n"},{"date":"2015-10-22T00:00:00.000Z","title":"The future of technology in the classroom","tags":["education technology"],"filename":"53","content":"<p>One of the things I spend a lot of time thinking about is education; or, more specifically the use of technology in education. I’m not a teacher, but I do work for a tech company whose goal it is to make education better.</p>\n<p>Recently the <a href=\"https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/frequent-use-school-computers-impairs-learning-finds-international\"><abbr title=\"Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\">OECD</abbr> released a report</a> that suggested that the use of technology in the classroom was having a detrimental effect on how well pupils were performing in standardised tests. As an organisation who really takes the time to try and understand education, Firefly certainly had a few thoughts on the report. One of our founders, Joe Mathewson, <a href=\"http://fireflylearning.com/blog/is-technology-good-or-bad-for-schools\">shared his thoughts on the report</a> on The BBC News Channel.</p>\n<p>As one of the people who designs software  used by hundreds-of-thousands of students, teachers and parents every day I have a responsibility to help build something genuinely useful. What we’re hearing loud-and-clear from teachers is that technology is just another tool, and is only useful when used alongside other tools and teaching methods.</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CatScutt\">Cat Scutt</a>, Head of Learning Technology and Innovation at the Girls’ Day School Trust, recently commented in her <a href=\"https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-views/yin-and-yang-using-mobile-technology-classroom\">TES article</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[E]ven if we focus on [academic achievement] alone, there is a fundamental flaw here in treating ICT as if it is a pedagogical approach in itself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It’s with this in mind that I’d like to consider what’s next for the classroom. Currently, mobile is the disrupter of the technological status quo. With tablets and phones now ubiquitous, computers have entered every part of the school day. But what happens next is anyones guess; the future is up for grabs. Of course there are indicators of what’s to come, decisions those in the know are making today that <em>may</em> affect the technology of tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Recently, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10101319050523971\">Facebook brought Oculus Rift</a> for $2billion. So why did they invest in a technology that seemed to have died on its arse in the mid 1980s? Well, Mark Zuckerberg certainly seems to be convinced <abbr title=\"Virtual Reality\">VR</abbr> is the next big thing in tech:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We have a lot more to do on mobile, but at this point we feel we’re in a position where we can start focusing on what platforms will come next.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Of course, not everyone is thrilled about Facebook’s acquisition of Oculus, some even suggesting that billionaire Zuckerberg simply loved the device, so he bought the company. However, it’s hard to ignore his vision, and it’s pretty clear what a difference <abbr title=\"Virtual Reality\">VR</abbr> could make to could make to the world beyond just games.</p>\n<p>A world stuffed full of Facebook ads aside, if <abbr title=\"Virtual Reality\">VR</abbr> is due to replace the screen, and change the way we interact with our environment, what does this mean for the classroom?</p>\n<h2>Early adopters</h2>\n<p>An enterprising teacher could, if they wished, start using <abbr title=\"Virtual Reality\">VR</abbr> now. Oculus sell <a href=\"https://www.oculus.com/en-us/dk2/\">Developer kits</a> so those with coding skills can build pretty much any experience they wish.</p>\n<p>Imagine a physics teacher explaining the structure of an atom to their students by immersing them in a world where she’s able to zoom deep into the environment and show the students how the atoms of their desks are arranged. If that sounds far-fetched then have a look at <a href=\"http://tomorrow-projects.com/classroom/\">the tomorrow project</a>, helping school children build their own 3D printable robots.</p>\n<p>I imagine some teachers and parents might see this as the ultimate nightmare scenario for the classroom; rows of students, all wearing goggles, hooked into the schools mainframe. No one speaks as information is simply downloaded into the student’s brain.</p>\n<p>What I’m suggesting here is something quite different. Unlike mobile devices, which by their nature prevent real-world social interactions, Virtual Reality simply adds another layer on top. This augmented reality would support real-world interactions in a way that mobile never can. However, I do think that the success of <abbr title=\"Virtual Reality\">VR</abbr> used in this way will very much depend on how unobtrusive the <abbr title=\"Virtual Reality\">VR</abbr> headsets / glasses / contact lenses can be made.</p>\n<h2>Wider integration</h2>\n<p>I think the mobile revolution has shown us that much of the technology innovation happening in schools is driven by students. Many schools have now adopted one to one or <abbr title=\"Bring Your Own Device\">BYOD</abbr> programmes as a direct kick-back against the tidal wave of devices being brought into school anyway, choosing to utilise technology, rather than have it serve only as a distraction.</p>\n<p>As with anything new, there have been varying levels of success, and the <abbr title=\"Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\">OECD</abbr> report is evidence of that. Personally, I think we’re over the initial hump. Teachers and <abbr title=\"Senior Leadership Teams\">SLTs</abbr> are much more switched on to the potential of mobile computing devices, and their pitfalls. The same will be true of future technology. As <abbr title=\"Virtual Reality\">VR</abbr> becomes more prevalent in everyday life, schools will learn how best to integrate it into their classrooms.</p>\n<h2>Alternative technologies</h2>\n<p>Another technology in its infancy, and one which has huge potential for schools, is smart surfaces. I recently listened to an extremely interesting <a href=\"https://royalsociety.org/stay-in-touch/rss/\">podcast from the Royal Society</a> called &quot;seeing clearly&quot;, in which <a href=\"http://www.phy.cam.ac.uk/directory/dr-dan-credgington\">Dr Dan Credgington</a> gave a brief outline of how we generate light, more specifically how we use <abbr title=\"Light Emitting Diode\">LED</abbr> technology to generate light.</p>\n<p>One of the areas he touched on was future materials, and how LEDs could be used to transform whole surfaces into light producing smart surfaces, and therefore, smart screens. Not only might this improve concentration levels in classrooms (by making the whole ceiling the light we could generate an ambient light level much closer to that of natural sunlight) but we could transform <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodeck\">all surfaces in the classroom into screens</a>.</p>\n<h2>Fanciful imaginings</h2>\n<p>Its fun to imagine what’s next, but for now all of us at Firefly are concentrating on our next set of apps for teachers, students and parents. And, as far as I know, we’ve no plans to release these for Facebook <abbr title=\"Virtual Reality\">VR</abbr> 1.0. At least, not yet anyway.</p>\n"},{"date":"2015-09-05T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Old hobbies die hard","tags":["drawing"],"images":[{"image":"2015-09-05_001.jpg","caption":"Toonin’ on a Saturday night","set":"cover"},{"image":"2015-09-05_002.jpg","set":"rabbits","caption":"Huey"},{"image":"2015-09-05_005.jpg","set":"rabbits","caption":"Dewey"},{"image":"2015-09-05_004.jpg","set":"rabbits","caption":"Louie"}],"filename":"52","content":"<p>As I kid I loved to draw cartoons.

I love it, not least as it lets me serve content directly from Github. Updating the site is as simple as pushing into my repository. I have no servers to maintain and no extra monthly costs. For a low traffic site it seems, for now at least, like the perfect solution.</p>\n<p>(figure set:artwork)</p>\n<p>To me, one of the most interesting things about writing a blog is the ability to look back, to make old posts new again with an easily navigable archive section. A key part of that is the ‘archives for year …’ page. However, hosting with Github pages means that I can’t use plugins for Jekyll that you’d normally need to achieve this. Jekyll doesn’t really offer much in the way of core functionality for archives, but with a bit of hacking you can create an archive page for every year in a way that doesn’t suck.</p>\n<p>We can use the power of <a href=\"http://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/\">Jekyll collections</a> to <em>somewhat</em> automatically generate an archive page for each year your site has posts. There’s three main parts to the setup:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Configure a collection for archives.</li>\n<li>Create a post for each year for which you want an archive page.</li>\n<li>Create a layout for processing each archive post into <abbr title=\"Hyper Text Markup Language\">HTML</abbr></li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Configure the archives collection</h2>\n<p>First, we need to tell Jekyll about our new collection. In my site configuration file, (usually <code>_config.yml</code>) I added the following:</p>\n<pre><code>collections:\n  archives:\n    output: true\n    permalink: /archives/:path/\n</code></pre>\n<p>This tells Jekyll that we want a collection called <strong>archives</strong>, that we want it to output an <code>index.html</code> for each item in the collection, and we want it to do so under the <code>/archives</code> url.</p>\n<h2>Create a post per year</h2>\n<p>Our new archives collection will read any markdown files in a folder named <code>_archives</code>, so we’ll have to create a post for each year your site has posts in this folder. This is why I say that this method is only <em>somewhat</em> automatic, however we’ll only every have to worry about updating this once per year.</p>\n<p>For example, if we want an archive page for 2015 at <code>archives/2015</code> we’d create the post <code>_archives/2015.md</code>. The only thing that’s really required here is YML front matter, here’s a simplified version of my <code>2015.md</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>---\ntitle: Archives for 2015\nyear: &quot;2015&quot;\nlayout: archive-year\n---\n</code></pre>\n<p>Don’t forget the quotation marks, the reason for them will shortly become apparent.</p>\n<h2>Archive page layout</h2>\n<p>Now we need to define a layout that Jekyll will use to output each archive page. I did this in a layout  <code>_layouts/archive-year.html</code>. Here’s a simplified version of my file:</p>\n<pre><code>---\nlayout: default\n---\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n\n{% for post in site.posts %}\n    {% capture post_year %}{{ post.date | date: '%Y' }}{% endcapture %}\n    {% if post_year == page.year %}\n            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;{{ site.baseurl }}{{ post.url }}&quot;&gt;{{ post.title }}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;       \n    {% endif %}\n{% endfor %}\n\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Its all pretty simple really. We’re looping though all the posts on the site, and only displaying them if they match the target year. By the way, those quotation marks from earlier are required for matching the <code>post_year</code> with <code>page.year</code>, which both have to be strings</p>\n<p>And that’s it. A <em>sort-of</em> automatic way to generate an archive page-per-year.</p>\n"},{"date":"2015-03-21T00:00:00.000Z","title":"What I talk about when I talk about beards","images":[{"image":"IMG_0184.jpg","caption":"The final product, far from perfect","set":"beard"},{"image":"IMG_0199.jpg","caption":null,"set":"shave"},{"image":"IMG_0208.jpg","caption":"The progress — What a knob","set":"shave"}],"cover":"IMG_0184.jpg","introduction":"_Twiddle, twiddle, scratch, scratch, scratch_.

Such has been my life over the past month. That ends this evening; the beard is gone.</p>\n<p>To share this tale of beard butchery, let me first set the scene: It’s 2015 and in the towns and villages of England the common hipster is alive and well. You’ll see him wherever you go, seeking to fit in with as little of what’s popular as possible.</p>\n<p>One thing this sub-non-culture of  has brought about is the resurgence of the beard. Please, hold the letters explaining how beards were popular long before the hipsters moved in; I know this, but as they’re so common place, down our way, I believe this was the thing that got me thinking about face-rugs. This, and a chap called Marc at work had grown the most impressive beard I’d ever seen on a real-life human man. It was like a Norse god had taken up residence in our office.</p>\n<p>It was, at the start of March, I had the thought of letting my face hair grow, unimpinged for as long as I could stand it.</p>\n<p>After a couple of weeks it was clear that this wasn’t going to be as easy as I’d first thought. Far from the majestic swept back locks that adorn the faces of Hittite statues, mine was more akin to the bush that lines the driveway at the end of our road.</p>\n<p>It was at this point I decided I needed some help. Having heard Marc talking about oiling his beard, I thought “Oh, I should <em>totally</em> do that!”. I, like, <em>totally</em> did too, using some of Katie’s pregnancy belly oil. It was the worst. By the end of the day my face smelled like a dead badger that’d been out in the sun for several days. Google to the rescue, and I found <a href=\"http://www.percynobleman.com/product/beard-oil/\">Percy’s beard oil</a>. Yes, it’s probably as hipster as hipster can be, but it’s also a brilliant product.</p>\n<p>Beard oil in hand I ploughed on, and was rewarded, even if I do say so myself, with half decent face hair. <em>Emphasis on the “half”</em>.</p>\n<p>(figure set:beard)</p>\n<p>So, why the change of heart? Why is the beard no more? Well, to be honest, it was all too much like hard work. Oh sure, I was a prince amongst men, but it all got a little too much. I couldn’t stop playing with it for one, not great if you want a great beard. Also, food would occasionally get stuck in there, and that’s a look that’s not that easy to carry off. The writing was on the wall for el beardo.</p>\n<p>Of course, I performed the obligatory shaving-off-into-stupid-styles ceremony, many of which, upon seeing my face, Katie threatened divorce.</p>\n<p>(figure set:shave)</p>\n<p>If this month has taught me anything, it’s that a good beard is no easy thing. It takes work. It takes the ability to leave it the hell alone. But, most of all, it takes a will of iron to push though the itchy stage.</p>\n"},{"date":"2015-03-20T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Partial Solar Eclipse","images":[{"image":"IMG_9976.jpg","caption":"The \"magical\" solar eclipse over Littlehampton","set":"seafront"},{"image":"IMG_0003.jpg","caption":"Mrs. M was impressed with the morning's events","set":"mrsm"}],"introduction":"The heady tale of one man's search for a magazine, resulting in him getting sky poop in his eye.

After the damp squib that was our final day in Italy, the well-appointed campsite <a href=\"http://www.lidomappo.ch\">Lido Mappo</a> was most welcome. And, what luck! A break in the weather which allowed Katie and I to get our tent up and once again double our living space. That evening we paid a brief (but expensive) visit to the campsite bar, then cooked-up a pasta-storm back at chez-Roobottom.</p>\n<p>We awoke on Tuesday to beautiful sunshine. Using a combination of extremely poor Italian and much better English (on the part of the campsite staff) we’d established the the thing to do 'round these parts was to take the air with a brisk walk into Lacarno.</p>\n<p>Being near the border Lacarno has brilliant mixture of Italian Joie de vivre and Swiss preciseness, that for us <em>slightly</em> obsessive compulsive types, is infinitely appearing. We ate pizza in the square before hiking up the many almost vertical side-streets to explore.</p>\n<p>(figure set:lacarno-square)</p>\n<p>I think the most abiding memory of this place is the view over the lake. I don’t really think there’s anything to separate this place from Lake Garda, it’s just different, but equally beautiful. I managed to get some pictures that <em>almost</em> capture some small part of it’s beauty. I imagine it’s hard to communicate the feeling you associate with a place through pictures or words alone. It’s probably why those that do are few and far between. I’m certainly not counting myself there, if you were wondering.</p>\n<p>(figure set:lake-magorie)</p>\n<p>In the afternoon we took the camper up the mountain to the Verzasca Dam where apparently, if you’re so inclined, you can do a <a href=\"http://www.trekking.ch/en/bungy/007-bungy-jumping-verzasca-like-james-bond\">220m bungee jump</a> just like James Bond in Goldeneye. As we weren’t feeling <em>that</em> adventurous we made do with scaring ourselves by gawping over the fence at the dizzying drop. Why, after seeing that, you’d want to tie a piece of elastic around your legs and jump off I really couldn’t guess.</p>\n<p>(figure set:verzasca)</p>\n<p>On Wednesday we moved on to Germany, excited for our next adventure, but with the glimpse of the heavy heart that always accompanies a return to reality after a spectacular holiday. And spectacular this holiday has certainly been. It seems surreal at this point we’ve already driven nearly 2,000 miles. Pat on the head, van, for not letting us down — Thank goodness we didn’t buy a VW.</p>\n<p>It’s a sign of how far north we now were that we saw the first British numberplate for almost two weeks. Then another, and another. By the time we arrived at <a href=\"http://www.trendcamping.de\">Trend Camping</a> we were surrounded by the buggers.</p>\n<p>(figure set:trendcamping)</p>\n<p>The campsite had a rather nice bar which severed traditional German fare and local ales. So, despite the mud, it got the thumbs up from us. Especially when we discovered the huge power-showers, with massaging side-jets and everything. Luxury.</p>\n<p>On Thursday we used the free bus and train pass that the campsite provided to visit the nearby <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfach\">Wolfach</a>, a jolly little place that was once the hub of log-rafting and home to the pom-pom hat.</p>\n<p>The center of the town is lovely, with cobbled streets and shops full of delicious looking things. It’s surrounded by glorious grassy hills and meadows, the kind you might imagine yourself running through into the arms of a Bavarian maiden. If you were so inclined.</p>\n<p>(gallery set:wolfach)</p>\n<p>And then it was Friday. Only two days left of our holiday. How did that happen? Oh well, we thought, nothing for it but to spend some time in Belgium.</p>\n<p>What an amazing find for our last night. <a href=\"http://www.iledefaigneul.com\">Camping Ile de Faigneul</a> is a site on it’s own island in the middle of a river. We’d have loved to spend more time in this tranquil place, but alas this was just an overnight stop on our way to Calais, the tunnel and home.</p>\n<p>(figure set:faigneul)</p>\n<p>We spent that last night as we did some many others, eating pasta, playing cards and watching Mad Men.</p>\n<p>So it was with heavy hearts that we made our way thorough France to the Eurotunnel. We just had time to shop in the insanely large supermarket complex in Calais before boarding our train back to normality.</p>\n<p>(figure set:calis)</p>\n<p>That was it then. The end of a fantastic adventure that was entirely too short. It got dark at some point while were under the sea. Emerging onto cold, damp British soil we felt ready for a bed that wasn’t <em>slightly</em> too short. Home then.

Headphones in, I’m listening to Fink’s “Sort of Revolution” extremely loud and enjoying an ice-cold beer. I lean my head back, and close my eyes against the sun as it dapples through the leaves above me. In the distance are the mountains that circle Lake Garda. Sparse clouds are suspended, seemingly motionless over the azure blue waters. Fuelled by the warmth of the sun, the melodic beat of the music and the haze from the alcohol I feel an almost zen-like sense of well-being. “This is perfect” I thought.</p>\n<p>In contrast to week one, when we’d travelled through five countries, we decided to slow the pace a little. After an epic drive our first stop was the Northern lake town of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nago–Torbole\">Torbole</a>, the windsurfers paradise, and <a href=\"http://www.campingalporto.it/camp/\">Camping Al Porto</a>. It felt Newquay-esq where board-shorts seemed to be the must-have fashion item of the season. The campsite was rather busier than those we’d been used to, but we managed to fit our van and awning on a shaded pitch thirty-seconds walk from the lake.</p>\n<p>(figure set:torbole)</p>\n<p>On the occasion of our first night in Italy, we did what we have the last two trips here: Find the most touristy looking restaurant and order the biggest pizza they have and a glass of the local beer. In this case it was <a href=\"http://www.forst.it/eng\">Forst</a>, brewed “just up the road” we were told.</p>\n<p>The next day we had ideas of taking windsurfing lesson but the wind didn’t seem to want to blow. It was probably too hot, so like us it decided to spend the day sunbathing and exploring the town. We also finally got the BBQ to work despite the crappy “just light the bag” charcoal, thanks to some German firelighters that almost took my face off.</p>\n<p>It was at this point we cheated a little by spending a few nights in a hotel south of the lake in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desenzano_del_Garda\">Desenzano del Garda</a>. “You know” said Katie “I’m loving being able to get out of the shower and being able to keep my feet dry.” I knew what she meant. I’m not proud to admit it but we really did wallow in the luxurious of it all.</p>\n<p>(gallery set:hotel)</p>\n<p>Peeling ourselves away from the hotel pool we ventured down the road to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirmione\">Sirmione</a>. Navigating the spit of land that forms a sort of natural pier into the centre of the southern bank of the lake — we parked and ventured over the bridge into down-town Sirmione. Here we indulged our inner tourist once again by eating gelato and watching the sunset.</p>\n<p>(figure set:sirmione)</p>\n<p>Having made a large dent in our holiday funds we checked out of the hotel and moved north around the lake to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazise\">Lazise</a>. Here we encountered the full glory of the Italian campsite. When you’re a good few kilometres from the centre on the main road you start to notice the signs. At first a just few, then more with increasing ferocity until they line the bank of the lake one after the other. You’re not, as we discovered, just expected to pick one and check-in. We spent an interesting couple of hours driving from site to site inspecting toilet blocks, pools, children’s entertainment and on-site bars before we finally gave in and just picked one.</p>\n<p>(figure set:lazisesite)</p>\n<p>Here we stayed and for four glorious days enjoyed the private beach and exploring the beautiful town. We swam, snorkelled and sunbathed. Ate gelato, pizza and even brought a fridge-magnet. No messing about, this was a proper holiday.</p>\n<p>Alas, it was time to move on. Switzerland and our final week beaconed. We have a week left and just over two-thousand kilometres back to the Euro-tunnel at Calais.</p>\n<p>To be continued…</p>\n"},{"date":"2013-09-07T00:00:00.000Z","title":"European Adventure Week One","section":"articles","introduction":"Being of noble birth Katie and I are taking in the sights of Europe on a three week grand tour","tags":["capervanning","travel","france","germany","austria"],"cover":"/assets/blog/covers/01-20150102233740.jpg","images":[{"image":"alps.jpg","caption":"Driving over the Alps","set":"alps"},{"image":"france.jpg","caption":"Our first night at Camping des Bruyeres","set":"france"},{"image":"adam-night.jpg","caption":"The view from our van at Campingplatz Adam","set":"adam"},{"image":"baden_lunch.jpg","caption":"Lunch in Baden-Baden","set":"baden"},{"image":"salzburg.jpg","caption":"Downtown Salzburg","set":"salzburg"},{"image":"pavilion.jpg","caption":"Katie outside the \"Sixteen Going on Seventeen\" pavilion","set":"pavilion"}],"filename":"41","content":"<p>Being of noble birth Katie and I are taking in the sights of Europe on a three week grand tour.</p>\n<p>However, having a chequebook that is of more moderate means we decided to conduct our trip in our campervan.</p>\n<p>As I write this, we are driving from Salzburg to Lake Garda through the Alps.

On the second day we managed to peel ourselves away and drove into Baden-Baden, where we partook of some very European things like eating outside and strolling along the promenade. Our Britishness didn’t like that very much and forced us onto the Dotto train so we’d feel more like tourists again. Phew.</p>\n<p>(figure set:baden)</p>\n<p>Sad as we were to leave, Salzburg beckoned, so we packed up the van and set off. This was another sweaty drive along Euro-route 52. Six hours later we were lost in the city. In situations like this Katie stays calm and I tend to overreact (a little). Ahem.

I’d once been here on a school trip but the only thing I remember with any clarity was the McDonalds. Katie kept insisting that the hills were alive with the sound of music, but I wasn’t sure what she meant by this.</p>\n<p>Arriving by bus into Mozartsteg we made our way through the square, past the stalls selling Bavarian hats and up the hill to the fortress Hohensalzburg. After exploring for a bit we sat, pretzel and beer in hand, admiring the stunning view over the mountains.</p>\n<p>(figure set:salzburg)</p>\n<p>Next, I discovered a little more about those musical hills with a Sound of Music themed bus tour of the city. I secretly really enjoyed this ride around the sights of the city made (even more) famous by the film.

I’ve tried to name each and every one of you who made 2008 such an amazing year.</p>\n<h2>January</h2>\n<p>Brr, January - There was <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/roobottommobile/2209064397\">snow</a>, My car reached <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/roobottommobile/2209860514\">111,111 miles</a>, and I finally got to see <strong>Rob &amp; Bekki Cotton</strong> on <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/roobottommobile/2209861688\">their barge</a>! One thing that does standout was the trip that <strong>Matt Clegg</strong>, <strong>Ben Marklew</strong>, <strong>John McNally</strong> and I took to the lakes to climb <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coniston_Old_Man\">The Old Man of Coniston</a>. A top weekend that, thinking back, makes me want to do more outdoor related stuff this year. You know, like the BIG outdoors rather than the tiny stuff you get in your local high street after stepping out of the kabab shop at 3am.</p>\n<p>(figure set:coniston)</p>\n<p>On January 15th it was a year since Katie’s dad passed away. <strong>Tony Sellwood</strong> was an amazing man… I tried to write something fitting about him shortly after he died, but couldn’t find the words. Similarly now, I’m struggling, but as the second year anniversary approaches in 2009 I remember him fondly as a joker with more time for people than anyone else I’ve ever met. I know he’s with God.</p>\n<h2>February</h2>\n<p>February was a bit of a mixture. At work, Glubble Family Edition was launched to a somewhat mixed reception. My abiding memory of this time was spending late nights at my parents (when our net connection was down) till 3am chatting with <strong>Ian Hayward</strong>, pushing pixels around interface designs.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere, <strong>Katie</strong> and I took a long weekend to Bath. I dunno why we did, but I’m sure that we did, as I have <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/roobottom/2327119659\">photographic evidence</a>. Life at Cherrytree was fun, as always, and <strong>Matt Clegg</strong> managed to bake a pie with the edibility of mild steel.</p>\n<p>(figure set:cleggpie)</p>\n<h2>March</h2>\n<p>As I write this review, it’s now that I wish I’d blogged more and taken a whole heap of photos. What did you achieve in March 2008 Jon? Oh, well, Katie and I dressed up like knobs and went to a party.</p>\n<p>(figure set:party)</p>\n<h2>April</h2>\n<p>April is my birthday month (just in-case you were thinking of buying me a present) and in 2008 I experienced my first ever <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/roobottom/2431709662/in/datetaken/\">Coke Float</a> thanks (mainly) to the fine work of <strong>Richard Kemp</strong>. I have yet to find a way to repay him for bringing such joy into my life. By this point of 2008 I was spending more and more of my time in Littlehampton (something to do with this random girl I met) and in <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/roobottom/sets/72157604532486601/\">April “LA” got snow</a>! Ah snow on the beach, <strong>Mark Wilson</strong>, <strong>Kamran &amp; Ellie Khan</strong>, <strong>Katie</strong> and I very much enjoyed pelting each other with snowballs.</p>\n<p>But by far the best thing about April was going to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isles_of_Scilly\">Scilly Isles</a>. It was hard to believe that just over a week before we’d had snow as, when we got there, it was hot hot hot! <strong>Sea Legs</strong> (heretofore know as <strong>Cath Hyslop</strong>), <strong>Katie</strong>, <strong>Katie’s Mum</strong> and I all spent a week in Sea Leg’s Mum’s cottage. Katie and Cath had years of family holiday history on the tiny islands, and had spent 6 months living and working on Scilly before traveling Australia for a year - So they knew most of the locals, but best of all knew all the best pubs.</p>\n<p>(figure set:waa)</p>\n<h2>May</h2>\n<p>The start of <em>some</em> warm weather prompted me to take the plunge and invest in some running shoes. And, needless to say, I was less than delighted when my first efforts yielded a total distance of 100 yards and a collapsed lung. Over the coming months though I did get <em>slightly</em> better, and having run an impressive <em>slightly further</em> I took the decision to enter a half marathon in February 2009. Which, actually, now I come to think about it is not very far off at all…Oh dear.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, our lovely (and by this I mean not at all a bunch of money-grabbing jobs-worths) letting agents had informed us that the landlord wanted to sell Cherrytree and we had to move out at the end of July. The hunt was on to find a new place where I, <strong>Matt Heaton</strong>, <strong>Matt Clegg</strong> and <strong>Steve Clark</strong> could live. Not too much effort went into this initially, after all how hard could it be to find a four bedroom house for let in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walsall\">Walsall</a>? To four, very, <em>very</em> clean living young gentlemen…</p>\n<h2>June</h2>\n<p>June went by in a blur. We still weren’t putting in too much effort on the house front, it was hot and not a time for sitting in writing blog posts. So consequentially I can’t recall anything that happened. Maybe the best solution for June would be a sign saying: &quot;scene deleted&quot;.</p>\n<h2>July</h2>\n<p>July was a month of big decisions. We still couldn’t find a place to live, and the time was quickly drawing near when we’d have to say goodbye to our beloved Cherrytree. A place in a shared house became available in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Littlehampton\">Littlehampton</a> (aka LA), and it seemed to be a no-brainer. It was certainly a lot closer to Katie than Walsall. But in typical Jon Roobottom style I couldn’t decide what to do for the best. This was it, if I moved it meant I really liked this girl.</p>\n<p>Thanks to the sterling efforts of <strong>Dan Mayley</strong>, and praying more than ever before, I finally saw the light and took the plunge. It was around this time that Glaxstar offered me a deal whereby I’d go freelance, but they’d guarantee me hours for a considerable block of time. How could I not? I’d been itching to get my teeth into some freelance stuff for months - I bit their arm off. God is good.</p>\n<p>A week before I left I went camping in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coed-y-Brenin\">Coed y Brenin</a>, Wales with some old mates; <strong>Paul Lloyd</strong>, <strong>Kris Benbow</strong>, <strong>Jon Ford</strong>, <strong>Lewis Burden</strong>, <strong>Lee Nash</strong>, <strong>Dave Handley</strong>, <strong>Mark Gosling</strong> and <strong>Jon Macey</strong>. Awesome is all I can say, it came at just the right time. Let’s hope we can do it again in 2009.</p>\n<p>The day before I left <strong>Hannah Kemp</strong> threw me a party at chez-kemp. Having spent the last 4 years in Walsall Community Church, this was above and beyond the best send off I could have asked for. Guys, each and every one of you has made Walsall special, and I really can’t express what it meant to me to have you all there for the party. Chatting, drinking, relaxing and eating part cooked bbq spare ribs with each one of you is an absolute pleasure.</p>\n<p><strong>Matt H</strong>, <strong>Matt C</strong>, <strong>Adam</strong>, <strong>Steve</strong>, <strong>AJ</strong>, <strong>Kempy</strong>, <strong>Hannah</strong>, <strong>Minnie</strong>, <strong>Esther</strong>, <strong>Sarah</strong>, <strong>Dan &amp; Erin</strong>, <strong>Andy &amp; Sue</strong>, <strong>Raz</strong>, <strong>Paul</strong>, <strong>Lee</strong>, <strong>Kirsty</strong>, <strong>Katy &amp; Ben</strong>, <strong>Lou</strong> and <strong>Paul &amp; Esta</strong>… Thanks for turning up to say goodbye… or maybe just making sure I leave. So on Saturday 26th July 2008 <strong>Kempy</strong>, <strong>AJ</strong>, <strong>Steve</strong> and I packed up a big van and moved my stuff into my new house.</p>\n<h2>August</h2>\n<p>I love the summer, and August didn’t disappoint for once - or it may have done, depending on how reliable my memory is. But I recall August as hot. Katie and I travelled back to my <strong>Mum &amp; Dad</strong>'s place in Walsall for his 60th birthday. I think he ended up paying for the meal, so, thanks dad.</p>\n<p>(figure set:dadsbday)</p>\n<p>It was also the big fruits’ birthday, so we celebrated <strong>Angie Tuffill</strong> being another year older in style with an American themed party. I think prizes went to <strong>Kamran Khan</strong> for the best costume as <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/roobottom/2908969397\">Uncle Fester</a>, although he’s not a million miles away from that normally.</p>\n<p>I also got to relive my youth by finally getting to see <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Levellers\">The Levellers</a> live at <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arundel_Castle\">Arundel Castle</a>. By the looks of some of the older gentlemen in the crowd, they’d been reliving their youth from just after lunch and by 8pm they’d relived so much they were probably going to regret that one in the office on Monday morning.</p>\n<p>(figure set:levellers)</p>\n<h2>September</h2>\n<p>September saw <strong>Annie &amp; Christian Powell</strong> get hitched, which was good news for all of us as we knew they’d throw a decent party. And they didn’t disappoint, with not one wedding party but two. Apparently the rave on Sunday night went on till 3am. I’m sure the 3 huge barrels of ale that Christian had invested in helped there.</p>\n<p><strong>Kamran Khan</strong> and I decided to service my car, I mean, how hard could it be? We got all the stuff and set about the task. 6 hours later we’d changed the air filter, just about managed to swap the spark-plugs and put a hole in the drivers side floor. Well, I say &quot;we&quot;, but the hole was mainly my fault. Still, my car seemed to run all the sweeter for our efforts.</p>\n<p>(figure set:service)</p>\n<p><strong>Cath Hyslop</strong> got baptised! Admittedly I was supposed to get dunked too, but I’m not all that great at making decisions.</p>\n<p>(figure set:cathbap)</p>\n<h2>October</h2>\n<p>October is <strong>Katie</strong>'s birthday month, and in true southern style we and a <em>few</em> others went for an all you can eat Chinese. I feel we really didn’t take full advantage of the ‘all you can eat-ness’ of the thing, especially Katie who powered her way through starters only… Well, OK she had about 2 tonnes of fried seaweed, but that’s not the point.</p>\n<p>The month was also memorable for a day trip Katie and I took to London. I’d been to London so much for work related stuff over the last few months, it was really nice to spend some time (and LOTS of money) exploring the city.</p>\n<p>(figure set:bigben)</p>\n<p>October was also the month when our new <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_group\">cell</a> really took off. I’d arrived in LA at a point where the cell-group was in flux, <strong>Claire Jones</strong> had decided to take a well earned break from her leadership role and we were waiting for a someone to step into the breach. But in October we decided that we’d take our cell in a new direction, each week we’d take it in turns to lead with whatever God had put on our hearts to share. So far it’s worked extraordinarily well.</p>\n<h2>November</h2>\n<p>November was awesome because of the <a href=\"http://www.walsallcommunitychurch.org/\">WCC</a> men’s weekend away at Standlake Ranch in Oxfordshire. Like the weekend away in 2007 it was an amazing time with God, and He did so much in my life that weekend, perfectly building on the previous year with perfect timing for everything that was going on in my life.</p>\n<p>(figure set:toads)</p>\n<p><strong>Flix &amp; Maryanne Gillett</strong> got hitched too! Gotta say guys the bangers and mash was inspired, and Flix’s speech is possibly one of the best I’ve ever heard.</p>\n<h2>December</h2>\n<p>The early part of December saw <strong>Katie</strong> and <strong>Cath</strong> jetting off to Hong Kong “Hongers” for a few days. Was I jealous? Yeah, a little, but I flippin’ hate flying with a passion so avoiding the 12 hour flight was some small consolation.</p>\n<p>Later in the month <strong>Katie</strong> and I took a week’s holiday in Scotland. I’d told her that I’d booked a B&amp;B and found a suitably crappy looking random guest house on the internet to fool her with. I’d actually booked a private cottage with a hot tub as I’d hatched a bit of a plan. When we got there, the post code on the cottage website took us to some random housing estate. Not to worry I thought, it can’t be far, I’ll just drive around til we happen upon it. An hour later I was getting a little stressed as all my plans for a surprise were rapidly going down the toilet. In the end I had to confess all and Katie knocked doors until we found someone who’d heard of the place.</p>\n<p>When we eventually arrived at the cottage I thought I’d booked (as there we’re two on the website, a one bedroom place and a three bedroom place) the lights were on, and we could here voices in the garden. “Hello?” I shouted as I walked around to the rear of the cottage. I was really fuming now, over an hour to find the place and the owners had double booked it!</p>\n<p>I was greeted with sight of a naked couple in the hot tub, she quickly moved, but he just sat there, and I couldn’t help but glance at the thing that was floating in the crystal clear, illuminated, water. “Erm…” I said, &quot;Have you booked this place, cos I think I have&quot;. He was actually quite polite, and as we made a quick exit we noticed that the driveway continued on to a larger property just around the corner. In my haste and annoyance I hadn’t realised that the place I’d booked was actually the three bedroom cottage. Oh well, you live and learn.</p>\n<p>That night, Katie and I relaxed with a bottle of wine and the promise of the hot tub bubbling away outside. I couldn’t wait any longer, she was clearly impressed with the way I’d handled the naked man and the iron was hot to strike. I sat her down, got on one knee and asked her if she’d be my wife. “Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa… really?!” she said. And then just kept on saying it. Eventually I had to ask her if that was a 'yes’. The ring didn’t fit, we’d seen too much nakedness, and all we had for dinner was fish fingers and chips. But it didn’t matter, the place was brilliant, and she’d said yes. I couldn’t be happier.</p>\n<p>(figure set:ring)</p>\n<p>As 2008 drew to a close, 17 of us played a murder mystery and then on <strong>Florrie Fuller</strong>'s suggestion we played musical statues to the small hours. Thanks to everyone who made my year so awesome, you know who you are (even if you’re not mentioned by name here). Here’s to a brilliant 2009, and look out for your wedding invites coming to a post box near you sometime in '09… We promise!</p>\n"},{"date":"2008-12-17T00:00:00.000Z","title":"She said Yes!","images":[{"image":"3116966434_4a4ca594ac_o.jpg","caption":"ring-ring","set":"ring"}],"tags":["life events"],"filename":"35","content":"<p>It’s been a while coming, but finally I popped the question and for some unknown reason Katie said yes!</p>\n<p>(figure set:ring)</p>\n<p>So this is it then, I’m off the market.

My first encounter with the webshite was when I tried to track my order. I clicked on the link from the email they sent me, only to discover that as I was already logged in - my session had expired. So I was given the link to log in, which I did, but then it takes me back to the O2 homepage. From here there’s no links to order tracking, so you have to go back to the email and re-click the link. Which then tells you your session has expired! In the end, the only way to access your order is to log out, click the link, copy the link, log back in, and paste the link… Nightmare.</p>\n<p>The next was MMS.

I even emailed O2 “Support” about this - to which their answer was “we know, we’re working on it, but don’t ask us how long to sort it 'cos our web team is clearly rubbish!”</p>\n<p>I could go on, but suffice to say that for a company who is as big as O2 you think they could afford to spend a few bob on some decent systems and developers.

He has given me abundant life, and given me new hope. When I returned from University in 2003, I was not a believer. In fact I cringed in embarrassment the one and only time I did make it to church. ‘What are these nutters doing?’ I thought, as all around me people we’re raising their arm and singing at the top of their voices in praise to their King.</p>\n<p>And then I went along again to church, for a friends wedding blessing. Again, at first, I was an awkward affair. I didn’t feel comfortable around these people making fools of themselves. But, right there in the middle of the midst of my embarrassment and endless questioning, God met me. I can describe this experience as nothing less than an amazing filling of God, the Holy Spirit. Things that I’d pushed right down, things I didn’t want to think about burst into my mind. The deep black endless pit of depression that I’d suffered with the previous five years was suddenly at the forefront of my mind. But there was something else, something much bigger than that; an overwhelming Joy.</p>\n<p>Tears streamed down my face as I too now worshiped God who’d given me this wonderful gift. It was a lightbulb moment, a sudden realisation that where I once thought there was nothing, there was indeed something. From that day I went looking for God.

After 7 nights in Italy drifting around Lake Garda, being awed (and a little romantic) in Verona and getting (very) lost in Venice the reality of being back to work has hit like a tonne of bricks.</p>\n<p>(figure set:lake)</p>\n<p>But I prefer to think of the amazing time we had. As we landed at the tiny Besica airport we realised that the turbulence we had just endured was in fact heavy rain that drenched us as we ran from the plane to the cover of the arrivals lounge. From there we found ourselves sitting in the hire car, rain pounding on the windscreen, trying to get used to the uneasy feeling of sitting in the passenger side with a steering wheel in front of me. By the time we reached <a href=\"http://www.mistralhotels.it/admiral.htm\">our hotel</a> we’d driven on three motorways and had a tiny disagreement with a barrier.</p>\n<p>Thankfully the wing-mirror was unharmed and the rain had stopped to reveal blue sky. Things got even better when we got into our room - it was clean, big and had a balcony from which you could see the lake (sort of) through the trees. We spent the week exploring Lake Garda’s small towns and excellent restaurants, and venturing out to Verona and eventually Venice after planning to go on Wednesday and finally getting there on Friday - Due to a couple of days missing the train. Whoops!</p>\n<p>(figure set:lake2)</p>\n<p>My favourite place by far was Sirmione which was at the end of an tiny outcrop of land that juts into the south end of the lake. We spent an evening at the naturally heated <a href=\"http://www.termedisirmione.it/tds/en/homepage.html\">spa</a> followed by dinner at <a href=\"http://www.ristorantearcimboldo.com/\">L’Archimboldo</a> run by a really friendly guy who’s English was better than ours. If you’re going to Lake Garda Sirmione is a must.</p>\n<p>(figure set:gondola)</p>\n<p>Venice was amazing. Stepping out of the station, you’re immediately greeted with throngs of people walking up and down the banks of the Grand Canal. Wow! We took a water taxi up to St. Marks Square and stopped for lunch and some shelter from the hot-hot sun before we ventured into St Mark’s Basilica and mooched around the Square, avoiding the millions of pigeons that randomly landed on anyone they fancied, whether they had food or not.</p>\n<p>We then set off around the labyrinth-like city on foot, exploring the seemingly unending passageways and tiny bridges. Needless to say we got horribly lost, and only just made our train back to the hotel. But I loved Venice, a day was just not enough. In usual style, I took nearly 700 photos - and you can <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/roobottom/sets/72157602449502521/\">see some of them over at flickr</a>.</p>\n<p>Oh well, back to reality I suppose.</p>\n"},{"date":"2007-09-11T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Pimp My Attitude","filename":"26","content":"<p>Last week I received a random e-mail from a lady calling herself “Yummy Mummy” that simply said…</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I have written about you, I hope you like it. x.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So with trepidation, I clicked on <a href=\"http://pimpmydaughter.wordpress.com/2007/09/04/jon-roobottom-the-churchgoing-hunk/\">the link</a>.

And yes, I’m aware how much you guys are going to take the p**s.</p>\n<p>It took me a while to work out what the hell was going on here. Apparently this woman, writing under the pseudonym of Yummy Mummy writes about “Amelia” her 18 year old daughter and how she needs to basically be more wise in the way of men. Its pretty weird stuff and morally questionable to say the least, but after a few emails to “Yummy” (staring with me asking ‘are you for real?’) I was assured that this wasn’t real, and was just to provoke interest in her blog.</p>\n<p>So needless to say, I don’t agree with what this woman is doing, but she has a much right to write what she thinks as the next guy… um, gal. I saw absolutely no point in sending her a message judging her for her actions. Then I received an email from Rose DesRochers who writes quite a <a href=\"http://rosedesrochers.todays-woman.net/\">nice little blog</a> and also runs <a href=\"http://www.todays-woman.net/\">Today’s Womans Writing Community</a>. She was trying to get me to force “Yummy” to take my photo off her blog. She seems to have quite a lot of anger about Pimp My Daughter, which I guess I can understand. However she did rather go off on one about how she thought that all MEN (yes, capitals) just saw a joke in this.</p>\n<p>I did rather feel caught in the middle, forced to take sides on an issue that I’d never really considered before. And I suspect that far from farming her daughter out “Yummy” is actually just massively taking the p**s.</p>\n"},{"date":"2007-04-26T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Kidz Klub Coalpool","images":[{"image":"473616523_54bbc19737_o.jpg","set":"hannah","caption":"Hannah painting the boards"}],"filename":"25","content":"<p>I’ve been involved in Kidz Klub (admittedly on and off) in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalpool\">Coalpool</a> for a while now, and this year I got to design the boards we use as a backdrop to the games we play with the local kids.</p>\n<p>I’ve loved working with the whole team over the last couple of years, and all credit to Esther, Sarah and the guys for the sterling work they do.

To get on the mound you first have to go in the shop and buy yourself a ticket. Upon exiting the shop you then make your way to the mound itself. Before ye can pass, ye must buzz the buzzer on the 5 foot (possibly electrified) gate. Then, when your identification has been verified using a series of voice and DNA checks, the gate is opened electronically.</p>\n<p>As we came down the mound we passed a guy who’d obviously missed the sign that said: “This mound costs a pound” and was chased down by the huge guy who worked in the shop. I wouldn’t have liked to get on the wrong side of him!</p>\n<p>So was the mound worth a pound? Well, we damn well made sure we got our money’s worth! A whole 30 minutes we sat on the mound.

For those who haven’t seen it, I really would recommend giving it a go, I’m not going to bother explaining the plot (you can read about it on imdb if you’re really that interested) but suffice to say its set in Africa, and shows in no uncertain terms the sometimes brutal existence that people live.</p>\n<p>The film catalysed me into writing about something I’ve been thinking about for the last few weeks: How privileged I am. When McClegg got back from India, he had lots of stories about the absolute poverty that people find themselves in. I can’t even begin to imagine living that life, the gulf between my luxury existence and the hand-to-mouth living that many of this world’s inhabitants endure is almost insurmountable. As the old saying goes…</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It could be worse</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>…and yes indeed it could be a lot worse. So this got me thinking about “accident” of birth. Is it pure chance that you are born into the family and circumstances you have? Does God control it? If so, it may seem a little unfair that I’m enjoying my decadent life while there are people suffering all over the world from a variety of different evils. I guess we could look at the “big” picture and say that everyone is dying, and the only purpose of this life is to drive us closer to our maker / the answers / any other generic thing that we as a species seek on a day-to-day basis.

I didn’t care what I looked like, I couldn’t interact with people anymore, something had broken inside me and I didn’t know what it was or how to make it better.  Slowly, so slowly I came out of it.

Yesterday lunchtime I had a wonder over the local supermarket, my mission was clear: To get some new tea bags to replace the 3 year old bumper pack of “20 million bags” we have lying around in the work kitchen.</p>\n<p>So imagine my displeasure when after 5 minuets drawing fresh water and boiling the slower-than-average kettle I came to get an Earl Grey bag for my cup only to discover i’d brought loose leaves! It’s some indication of the lengths I’ll goto to amuse myself at work that I was <strong>this</strong> gutted about the lack of decent tea. And then to spend another 10 minuets taking a picture of the tea, uploading it, then writing about it as-well… Anyway, in conclusion, I like tea. A lot.</p>\n"},{"date":"2006-01-08T00:00:00.000Z","title":"My Spritual Home?","filename":"11","content":"<p>Being a Walsall boy by birth, I’m very much inclined to do put-down my home town.

Which meant I had one small bottle of larger. Apparently on the journey home I failed to indicate at an island, so was merrily pulled over, blue light’s-a-flashing. To be fair the two officers were very nice about the whole thing, and I kinda felt sorry for them wasting their time on me and a mountain of paperwork, still not the most pleasant way to end your night. Guess it’s taught me a lesson though… Don’t drink and drive. At all. Not a drop.</p>\n"},{"date":"2005-12-15T00:00:00.000Z","title":"The Rain in Spain","tags":["travel"],"images":[{"image":"metro-in-spain.jpg","caption":"The Metro ~ Plaza de Espana","set":"a"}],"filename":"9","content":"<p>(figure set:a)</p>\n<p>Isn’t it funny how you meet new people?

As I reached the end of the lane, a gate to my left was all that separated to from the now huge throng of cows amassing before me.</p>\n<p>Luckily I had my camera, and just managed to take this snap before the maddened crowd, who were now threatening to burst through onto the path, got too leery!

Anyway, this post is all about Birmingham in a good way, which is quite unusual if you’ve ever spoken to anyone who lives locally about the &quot;capital of the Midlands&quot;. Usually Birmingham gets a bit of a bad wrap. Let’s face it, people think its crap, (feel free to correct me on this). But I’m happy to say that Birmingham is undergoing a bit of a renaissance period at the moment.</p>\n<p>Over the last 5 or so years the city council (and no doubt a medley of other investors) have pumped a shed load of money into re-vamping the city centre. It’s the new things that make the old things look better. Okay, I know this is an ambiguous sentence, but when you offset some of the older building and features in Birmingham (such as the candy coloured fence, which is in Bridge Street by the way) against the clean lines of the new building, you get something spectacular. Birmingham has come a long way since it’s massive decline in the 80’s and early 90’s, and I know it’s still got a log way to go, but it’s showing a lot of promise!</p>\n<p>Don’t be put off by the stories of old, come and visit Birmingham.

The French Prime Minister said that the Olympic defeat pales into the insignificance. Today, he said, we all stand as Londoners.</p>\n<p>The Muslim council of Great Britain have condemned the attacks and called for calm.

These are supposedly the pinnacle of tea technology, forced into the barren wasteland left by the pyramid bag.

So the couples happy day came, Lee fluffed his lines, Lloydy got VERY drunk, and I suddenly didn’t feel as old after all. All in all a good day was had by all. The best bit being the hour rant that someone had in the loo, i’ll post the video soon if he (or she, don’t want to incriminate anyone… Although that would’ve meant I was filming in the girls toilet), will let me.</p>\n<p>The bank holiday called for some <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/roobottom/sets/394848/\">biking in the Wyre Valley</a> with the lads. What can I say, as usual a top day out, and got me some more footage for the &quot;rant cam&quot;.</p>\n<p>I (and several others from church) took a visit to a mosque in Pleck for one of their open days. It’s a really good idea, they open up the whole thing, show you round, feed you (yes, a BIG factor in deciding to go) and give you this talk on Islam. I’m impressed with anything that helps build bridges between communities, so a big thanks to those guys for making us feel so welcome.</p>\n<p>Another biking session brought me <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/roobottom/17616354/\">this very nice wound</a> and a couple of bruised ribs (hence the “ouch”).</p>\n<p>Which I guess brings me up to this week, that has so far conceited of work, a joint cell with the guys from <a href=\"http://www.eurostreams.co.uk\">Eurostreams</a> (an absolutely awesome night), the Tuesday night pub quiz, and a bit of a Bulti (init mate) with Steve, Paul, Ben and the rest of the guys from WCC. All that, plus the usual pub nights, cinema, the quiz and the odd jamming session here and there have made for a pretty sweet, two (or so) weeks.</p>\n<p>Interesting, eh?

The meal was awesome, and spirits were high, so we decided that camping would actually be a <em>really</em> good idea. I knew of a camp-site, nothing special, but this was camping right? We’d got tents and sleeping bags, what more did we need? We set off, Jayne leading the way, the last of the warm spring sun disappearing behind the rolling hills.</p>\n<p>About half way to the site, a few spots of gentle rain began to appear on the windscreen. We wiped them away. The closer we got; the rougher the roads became, the rain was now slightly more than a a gentle smattering, and we were starting to think this was a bad idea.</p>\n<p>We finally arrived at <a href=\"http://www.peakdistrict.org/pubs/access4all/byne.htm\">Eric Byne camp-site</a> it was dark, pissing down, and bloody cold.
