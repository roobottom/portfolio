Designers have long had the idea of designing interfaces from a kit of pre-built parts, but never really had the tools to do this effectively. Sketch is such a tool.</p>\n<p>At Firefly, we made the transition to Sketch specifically because of the power of symbols. These have enabled us to build our pattern library in a way that helps us to do some extremely rapid prototyping and create consistent experiences for our users.</p>\n<p>Our Front-End and iOS teams already have their own pattern libraries. These are different, partly due to technical reasons, but there’s another reason we kept the patterns separate. As we continue to strive for feature parity between platforms, its obvious that there are some fundamental differences between web and iOS.  There is a <em>way</em> of doing things in iOS — interactions that users expect — that’s different from the web. Hence, web and iOS have the same features, but implemented in the way that makes the most sense to users of that platform.</p>\n<p>Our dream was to create two design pattern libraries that would contain the same elements as the web and iOS libraries. This would mean that we’d all be working from the same list of patterns, rather than adding a translation step when it came to implementation.</p>\n<h2>Structure</h2>\n<p>We studied the structure of the existing pattern libraries and created a map that included all patterns, their modifiers and states. This gave us the structure for our patterns, and a place to start from when translating programatic patterns into something that would be useable in Sketch.</p>\n<p>In simple terms, our pattern library is a number of Sketch files containing — as symbols — all the elements in the Firefly interface. We divide these into separate files, one for each platform. We’ve also broken web into web-core and one file for each of our <a href=\"http://themes.fireflylearning.com\">four core themes</a>.</p>\n<p>In each of the files, we’ve categorised our symbols into areas. This helps massively with your mental model when browsing the symbols page. This also allows us to print a visual style-guide of all our patterns.</p>\n<p>(figure set:categorising,class:poke-both)</p>\n<h2>Symbols</h2>\n<p>Sketch supports symbol nesting and overrides. This makes symbols extremely powerful. This allows you to create a pattern element by combining symbols together.</p>\n<p>However, organisation is everything. If you don’t follow a systematic approach to creating patterns, they’re extremely difficult to use in the wild. We know from experience that confusion arises about which symbols are patterns, and which are simply the building blocks of patterns. Let me explain…</p>\n<h3>Parts and Patterns</h3>\n<p>(figure set:button-anatomy,class:pull-right)</p>\n<p>A pattern is made up of either parts or other symbols. Each part is a symbol. A Button, for example, is made up of two parts <em>Background</em> and <em>Label</em>, and another pattern <em>Icon</em>. We use <a href=\"https://www.sketchapp.com/learn/documentation/symbols/organizing-symbols/\">slash notation</a> to organise parts and patterns under one namespace.</p>\n<p>(figure set:dropdown,class:poke-both)</p>\n<p>Organising our symbols this way makes it easy when using a pattern. It’s immediately obvious from the list of symbols which is a pattern that’s intended for use, and which are just the building blocks of patterns.</p>\n<h3>Using Patterns in the wild</h3>\n<p>When designing a new feature, we’ll start out with a blank sketch file. Let’s say, for example, that we wanted a very simple interface that required two buttons: OK and Cancel. OK needs to be a cancel type with a tick icon, and Cancel needs to be a default type with a cross icon.</p>\n<p>In our pattern library file, we have a page called <em>scratch</em> where we can set up a pattern ready to be copied into another file. We select the <code>Button &gt; Patterns &gt; Button with Icon Left</code> symbol from the list and drop it into our scratch page. We can then use the symbol overrides to change it’s Background, Icon and Label as required. We can also override the text.</p>\n<p>(figure set:using-a-symbol,class:poke-both)</p>\n<p>Once the pattern is set up, we can then copy this into the new document. This only copies the parts required for this instance of the pattern. So trying to change the symbol overrides in the new file won’t work until you copy over all variations of a pattern.</p>\n<h2>Tips ’n tricks</h2>\n<p>There’s a few areas where symbols are ripe for improvement. Given Bohemian’s track record for updates and bug fixes I suspect these can’t be too far off. Meantime, there’s a couple of workarounds that we’ve found particularly useful that I’d like to share.</p>\n<h3>Pin to corner</h3>\n<p>The ability to change resize behaviour in symbols is extremely useful. However, the “Pin to corner” option is somewhat limited as it doesn’t let you specify <em>which</em> corner.</p>\n<p>(figure set:pintocorner,class:pull-right)</p>\n<p>We solve this by simply grouping a transparent shape in with the layer we wish to align. This allows you pin to other corners than the one that Sketch might have automatically picked for you.</p>\n<h3>Override colours of icons</h3>\n<p>It’s annoying to have to have separate symbols for different icon colours. Especially when adding a new colour, meaning you have to create a new symbol for all the icons in the new colour.</p>\n<p>Luckily, we can use layer masks and overrides to easily add colour options. An Icon pattern is actually a grouped rectangle masked out by the icon shape. We are then able to control the icon type <em>and</em> colour from a pre-defined pallet of colours. Adding a new colour is as easy as adding a new icon mask symbol.</p>\n<p>(figure set:overridecolour,class:poke-both)</p>\n<p>Another small tip: Make your icons and masks different sizes, that way you won’t get shown all the icons and colours together in the overrides dropdown.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Sharing patterns</h2>\n<p>So far I’ve not really touched on how we’re using our pattern library across a team. An essential part of any pattern library is its use beyond a single person. When we set out to create our pattern library, we had a simple set of requirements:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Symbols should be stored in a central location that is accessible by the whole team</li>\n<li>Symbols can be linked across files, updating a symbol in any file updates it everywhere</li>\n<li>Editing clashes are handled in a nice way</li>\n<li>Symbols can be organised into categories</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>What we’re currently doing</h3>\n<p>Initially we experimented with <a href=\"https://www.invisionapp.com/craft\">Craft</a> from inVision. It’s library functionality would allow us to store symbols in a central location, share them across the team. Most excitingly of all, symbols would be linked across files, meaning we could ensure we were always using the latest version in our designs.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, when it came to handling editing clashes, Craft did less well. We lost an entire week of work due to our library file becoming corrupted. We were told that this was a known issue, and the file was unrecoverable. We decided not to entrust our entire pattern library to Craft, there was no way we could risk that happening again.</p>\n<p>We switched to using Sketch files themselves to contain our patterns. A downside to this solution was that editing clashes weren’t handled, at all. Rather, whoever saved the file last would overwrite work of anyone else. Thankfully, <a href=\"https://abstractapp.com/\">Abstract</a> came to our rescue.</p>\n<p>The team has been using Abstract for version management of Sketch files for the last few weeks, and what a difference it’s made! Once you have the git mental model in your head, Abstract’s workflow makes a lot of sense. We can now branch off the master pattern library document, make our changes, and merge back. Clashes are handled visually, giving you the choice of which symbol definition to keep.</p>\n<p>(figure set:abstarct,class:poke-both)</p>\n<p>We now have three out of four of our original requirements. We’re almost there! But what about linking symbols across files?</p>\n<h2>A native solution?</h2>\n<p>I’d argue that level of complexity represented by shared symbols in Sketch requires a native solution. Plugins, like Craft, will only ever be a poly-fill at best.</p>\n<p>Looking at the features that Bohemian have added to Sketch over the last few versions, I strongly suspect that they’re already planning shared symbols. It’s a natural fit for them, they already have the cloud infrastructure from Sketch Cloud and with their new open JSON formatted files, it seems like this might be the next logical step.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Are you looking for a new design challenge in London?

This time I’m going to talk about some the front-end technology and practices we used to help us build more robust software.</p>\n<h2>We built a pattern library</h2>\n<p>Until Firefly 6, it was usual practice to build features one-by-one. There was little re-use of code, meaning if we found a bug with an element, then we’d have to fix it multiple times.</p>\n<p>What we needed was a pattern library! In October we were joined for a few days by Anna Debenham who literally wrote the book on <a href=\"http://www.maban.co.uk/projects/front-end-style-guides/\">front-end style guides</a> to help us catalogue Firefly’s user interface.</p>\n<p>(figure set:anna)</p>\n<p>We used this to build a “single source of truth” library of interface elements. This means that Firefly is now essentially built from a kit of parts. If we need a button, we can just call one in from the library. Even better, if we find a bug with the button, we can fix it once, and its fixed everywhere. Much faster and a lot more robust.</p>\n<p>I also have to mention <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniellehuntrods/\">Danielle Huntrods</a>, a contractor who worked with us for almost a year, during which she built the majority of the of the pattern library. It was her brilliance that gave us such a solid foundation for the future.</p>\n<p>We plan (at some point) to release a publicly accessible version of the pattern library. This is part of our ongoing commitment to openness and giving back to the web community. Hopefully others will find what we’ve done useful.</p>\n<h2>We flattened the cascade</h2>\n<p>Cascading Style Sheets, or CSS, is the language that allows us to define the visual appearance of web pages. Firefly uses quite a lot of it.</p>\n<p>CSS uses something called a “Cascade”, meaning that elements can inherit their style from other elements that use the same HTML. For example:</p>\n<pre><code>button {\n    background-color: blue;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Means all <code>button</code> elements on the page would have a blue background.</p>\n<p>However if you wanted to make one red, you can give it a name, and use that name in the CSS to override the background colour to red. Useful and straightforward enough.</p>\n<p>However, The problem with this comes when you have thousands of elements. Sometimes, when you style one element, because of the way CSS cascades, you inadvertently style another element you didn’t mean to.</p>\n<p>We solve this at Firefly by using a way of writing CSS called BEM, or Block Element Modifier. This allows us to effectively remove the cascade by using a naming system that guarantees that  you only ever style the specific element you meant to.</p>\n<p>This is great for us at Firefly, as it means we ship far less styling bugs. And it makes it easy for us to fix those bugs that do slip through, knowing that we’re not going to accidentally  cause more bugs elsewhere.</p>\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/\">read more about BEM here</a>, on the excellent CSS Tricks website.</p>\n<h2>We became more Reactive</h2>\n<p>Firefly makes heavy use of the other great language of the web: Javascript. This is the technology that allows us to manipulate the interface in real-time, without having to reload the page every time you take any action within Firefly.</p>\n<p>To help us write better Javascript, we’ve stared using a library called <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/react/\">React</a>. React was developed by Facebook to solve some of the challenges they were facing when building their website.</p>\n<p>To understand why this is good for Firefly, lets look at a practical example of a feature we introduced in Firefly 5: The Markbook.</p>\n<p>The Markbook is a highly interactive screen with lots of different states. We use Javascript to manage these states. However, this is where things get complicated very quickly. The developer must remember to update <em>all</em> the states when the user interacts with <em>any</em> of the states.</p>\n<p>For example, opening one popup will need to close any others. As you add more and more states, this compounds the problem. This is the source of many bugs, as developers can’t keep all these things in their heads all at once.</p>\n<p>(figure set:markbook)</p>\n<p>React manages states for you, by keeping its own internal copy of the page’s HTML, (what’s known as the Document Object Model, or DOM). It continually compares <em>its</em> model  to the real DOM that’s shown to the user, and updates it on the fly.</p>\n<p>In this way, things like closing one popup when another is opening can be controlled by one simple rule, and React handles the rest. This is leads to less bugs and happier users.</p>\n<p>We make use of React in the new Task Details screen, where teachers can mark student’s work in a variety of ways. This screen has hundreds of different states, all managed reliably by React.</p>\n<h2>We simplified our themes offering</h2>\n<p>This was perhaps the most controversial changes we made with made in Firefly 6. We did this to improve the user experience of the majority of users in Firefly, but quite understandably some schools were disgruntled when they discovered that we were retiring Columnist and Angular. We were also removed support for a number of custom themes we’d built for some of our long-standing clients.</p>\n<h3>Fewer bugs</h3>\n<p>Themes have always been the source of front-end bugs within Firefly. Each theme has its own HTML with which it “wraps” standard Firefly elements (like resource page content, or the Markbook for example). It also has its own CSS with which it will restyle the standard Firefly elements.</p>\n<p>This means that when we release new feature or updates existing ones, we also have to update the themes. The more themes, the more updates we have to do. Obviously, this model doesn’t scale well. So we’ve reduced the number of themes we offer to ensure that when we release updates, we can ensure that all our schools have a great experience.</p>\n<h3>Theme Variables</h3>\n<p>What about theme customisation? Many schools want to inject their personality into the tools they use every day. In Firefly 5 we introduced <strong>Theme Variables</strong> to do just this. We improved them in Firefly 6 (more about that later), but its worth covering the basics:</p>\n<p>Firefly uses a CSS pre-processor called <em><a href=\"http://lesscss.org/\">Less</a></em>. This allows us to store colours as variables, and manipulate them programatically. For example, Melody has a variable called <code>@background-colour</code>, thats used in different places throughout the interface. <em>Less</em> allows you to use an array of <a href=\"http://lesscss.org/functions/#color-operations\">colour operation functions</a> to do things like darken or lighten colours. This is particularly useful for creating a harmonious colour scheme.</p>\n<p>We also use <em>Less</em> to check the relative contrast between two colours. For example, lets say we have a box, styled like this:</p>\n<pre><code>.box {\n    background-colour: @background-colour;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>We’d want to check that any text that’s put inside that box is legible. We can do this with <em>Less</em> by checking the contrast of two alternative colours <em>against</em> a background colour, and using the one which is most legible, like so:</p>\n<pre><code>.box {\n    background-colour: @background-colour;\n    color: contrast(@background-colour, black, white);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>All of which means that, per school, we can override these core variables with school colours, and be assured that the interface will still look great, and all text will be legible.</p>\n<h3>Better theme options</h3>\n<p>We’ve done a lot of work in Firefly 6 to improve and streamline the Theme Variables. Each theme now only requires a small set of colours. Every other colour used within the interface is based-off this core set.</p>\n<p>We’ve also removed a number of theme options that weren’t really adding much value for schools. For instance, lots of schools told us that they didn’t really care about things like background patterns, or changing fonts. We now use smart defaults instead.</p>\n<p>We’ve paved the way to style more of the interface based-off the schools’ colour choices in the future, all in a way that will work with feature updates we make.</p>\n<h2>Wrapping up</h2>\n<p>I hope you’ve found these couple of articles interesting. We like to be as open as possible about the way we build software. Hopefully this has given you an insight into the internal workings here at Firefly, and the things we’ve done to ensure we’re delivering the absolute best product possible.</p>\n","intro":"This is part two of a two part article all about building Firefly 6 and the lessons we learned along the way.","humanDate":{"dayName":"Monday","day":"23rd","month":"January","year":"2017","date":"Monday, January 23rd 2017","season":"Winter"},"next":{"title":"Design sprints at Firefly","url":"4","date":"2017-02-13T00:00:00.000Z"},"prev":{"title":"The road to Firefly 6, part 1","url":"2","date":"2017-01-16T00:00:00.000Z"}},{"title":"The road to Firefly 6, part 1","date":"2017-01-16T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["Firefly","design"],"images":[{"image":"big-red-button.jpg","caption":"Robin, Viv and I gather around the beautifully designed button to activate Firefly 6 in our offices in Hammersmith, 12th December 2016","set":"A"},{"image":"me-user-testing.jpg","caption":"Me doing some user testing at the Firefly Learning Conference in Birmingham, November 2016","set":"testing"},{"image":"sketching.jpg","caption":"An early sketch from a sketching workshop we ran at  the Firefly offices","set":"testing"},{"image":"team-firefly.jpg","caption":"Almost all of Team Firefly at the Firefly Learning Conference in Birmingham, 15th November 2016","set":"team"},{"image":"office-1.jpg","caption":"Firefly’s new offices at the Aircraft Factory, Hammersmith.","set":"office"},{"image":"office-2.jpg","caption":"Joe’s old Raleigh Firefly bike in pride of place at the Firefly offices in Hammersmith, October 2016","set":"office"}],"url":"2","content":"<p>Recently, Robin, Viv and I had the honour of pushing the (literal) big red button that would enable our clients to upgrade to Firefly 6. Champaign corks were popped and pizza was enjoyed by the whole team before we, very quickly, very diligently, returned to work.</p>\n<p>(figure set:A)</p>\n<p>Now seems like a good point to pause, and look back on the past eighteen months and the changes we made to our team, technology and working practices that enabled us to release the biggest step-change in Firefly to date.</p>\n<p>I’ve broken this article into two parts: This first part starts with journey in time from the deep dark past of April 2015 right up to the present day. We learned a lot about <em>how</em> to build great software in this time, so I’ll talk about that at the end.</p>\n<p>In part two (spoiler alert) I’ll talk about the changes we made to our technology stack and our design and front-end development teams.</p>\n<h2>Spring/Summer 2015</h2>\n<p>Back in April 2015 we knew <em>roughly</em> what teachers, students and parents wanted from the next version of Firefly. However, there was still lots of work to do to refine our ideas into a definite, focused list of features that would work for everyone.</p>\n<p>As Head of Product, Viv ran a number of discovery workshops with teachers, students and parents from a large number of our schools. Armed with this research, our UX team was able to start sketching solutions from which we could create interactive product mock-ups. These were then tested with more users, refined, and tested again.</p>\n<p>(figure set:testing)</p>\n<p>We didn’t just limit this discovery phase to the start of the project, we continued to conduct user research at every stage. We’re lucky that our clients don’t mind acting as guinea pigs and let us test all our crazy new ideas on them. We also engaged an agency to connect with non-client teachers, students and parents, to ensure that the new features would work for everyone, not just those used to Firefly already.</p>\n<h2>Autumn/Winter 2015</h2>\n<p>While research and design were progressing nicely, thoughts turned to a busy conference season. With the Firefly Learning Conference just around the corner and Bett looming, we knew we needed something more tangible than interactive mock-ups to show people.</p>\n<p>Bett, in particular, would be the first time clients and prospects alike could get hands-on with the new Firefly. We had to build a demo version of Firefly that would work well enough to give prospective clients a taste of what was to come in Firefly 6, that would also be robust enough to work with the WiFi in the ExCel centre.</p>\n<p>In a sterling effort by all involved, we cut a demo-ready version of Firefly less than 24 hours before the start of the show. Despite there being a few bits of hidden sticky-tape and string holding everything together, we had an amazingly successful Bett. The demo stood up to anyting our stand visitors threw at it, and I think its fair to say that everyone was suitably wowed.</p>\n<h2>Spring/Summer 2016</h2>\n<p>At the Firefly Learning Conference in November we’d confidently told our clients that they could expect Firefly 6 in the summer term. By the spring it was apparent that we couldn’t meet this deadline and release a version of Firefly that was of sufficient quality. So we took the difficult decision to delay the release to the next logical point where schools would have a chance to install it in-between terms: Christmas.</p>\n<p>In the summer we we’re able to release the new navigation, and because it was now in the hands of schools quickly iterate it based on feedback from a large group of users. As with all changes, it was met with a mixed reception, but the vast majority of users loved the changes we’d made.</p>\n<h2>Autumn/Winter 2016</h2>\n<p>We were now nearing the end of our development phase. A significant portion of both the web app and native iOS and Android apps had now been completed. We were on target for our completion date of 28th November, which would give us 2 weeks to do final testing before launch on 12th December.</p>\n<p>Building software is hard; Building great software is very hard. So it was understandable that the final few weeks before our production deadline was filled with late nights and many take-outs in the office.</p>\n<p>It is a testament to the diligent work of everyone involved that we brought this incredible new version in on time. Not just the team who built the software, but also the support, client experience, sales and marketing teams. They’re all responsible in equal part for Firefly 6.</p>\n<p>(figure set:team,class:span-both)</p>\n<h2>Please release me, let me go</h2>\n<p>Even the most old school software companies release their software more often than every 18 months, so why did we take a year-and-a-half to release Firefly 6?</p>\n<p>Well, the reality is that we were releasing, every two weeks in fact. We shipped <strong>35</strong> versions from <code>5.2.1</code> in April 2015 to <code>6.0.1</code> on 12th December 2016. These releases included a large number of bug fixes, and lots of new features and tweaks to existing features.</p>\n<p>So why was 6 such a big release? Well, this was such a step change that there were several Epics that wouldn’t make sense in isolation. For example, the new <em>Set A Task</em> flow allows teachers to create rich tasks with far more flexibility than tasks they could create in Firefly 5. Releasing this without any ability for students to respond to these tasks, or teachers then to mark the response was simply unfeasible.</p>\n<h2>Things we learned and changes we made</h2>\n<p>We’ve certainly have learned a thing or two along the way, not least that we need more development resource, but having just landing the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/15/firefly-takes-5-6m-series-a-for-its-learning-support-platform-for-schools/\">largest Series A investment</a> in Education Technology in the UK, we’re certainly now in a position to do that.</p>\n<p>It wouldn’t have been possible to build such complex software with a relatively small team without some smart ways of working. Over the last year-and-a-half we’ve made some big changes to the way we work, these help us work faster and release less bugs.</p>\n<h3>We established Epics, Squads and Guilds</h3>\n<p>We spilt sets of features up into logic chunks. These, we call <strong>Epics</strong>. An Epic is a set of features that makes sense end-to-end. For example, the new task setting flow was a single Epic. This included all the backend logic, and user interface elements for teachers, parents and students.</p>\n<p>Each Epic is owned by team called a <strong>Squad</strong>. A Squad is a self contained unit of UX’ers, Designers, Developers and a manager. Everyone who’s needed to research, design, build, refine and manage workflow for that one Epic.</p>\n<p>There are parts of the product that are relevant to more than one Squad. For example, the Pattern Library is used by all squads working on the Firefly web interface. To manage changes and updates to these areas we have <strong>Guilds</strong>. Typically a Guild will contain a representative from each Squad, and meet on an ad-hoc basis when changes are needed.</p>\n<h3>We moved</h3>\n<p>It would be remiss of me not to mention our new office. In October we moved from Lyric Square to the Aircraft Factory, in Hammersmith. We now have an amazing space that feels far more attuned to building brilliant software. We even have Joe’s old Raleigh Firefly bike (the inspiration for the name) in pride of place above his desk.</p>\n<p>(figure set:office)</p>\n<h3>We established the Nine Rules</h3>\n<p>I think what we’ve learned can be distilled into a set of principles that we’ve refined throughout this project. These are <strong>Firefly’s Nine Rules:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Frequent tasks should be easy and occasional tasks achievable</strong>. Teachers are incredibly busy, don’t give them a vast array of options.</li>\n<li><strong>Use smart defaults.</strong> We make good choices, so users don’t have to.</li>\n<li><strong>Don’t make me think.</strong> Make the next action obvious and unambiguous. Reduce unnecessary choices.</li>\n<li><strong>Beautiful by default.</strong> Teachers want to be proud of the things they create, so make this easy for them,</li>\n<li><strong>Optimise.</strong> Firefly should be fast.</li>\n<li><strong>Do less.</strong> Firefly should do a core set of things extremely well.</li>\n<li><strong>Design for teaching, not content management.</strong> Firefly isn’t a content management system, its a learning tool.</li>\n<li><strong>Right feature at the right moment.</strong> Too many options are confusing, be smart about when we expose a new feature.</li>\n<li><strong>Firefly isn’t just used in school</strong> Users should be able to achieve their task, no matter their location.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Where next?</h3>\n<p>Its an exciting time for Firefly. We’re expanding our team, and we’re brimming with ideas for the future. We’re working closely with a wide array of our clients to shape the next iteration of Firefly. There won’t be a large release for a while, but that’s exciting in itself, it means we’re going to work on smaller features that we can get into your hands quicker. I, for one, can’t wait to see what the next eighteen months brings.</p>\n","intro":"Recently, Robin, Viv and I had the honour of pushing the (literal) big red button that would enable our clients to upgrade to Firefly 6.

Having being promoted the role of Head of Design fairly recently, I found the vast majority of the talks and both workshops extremely poignant.</p>\n<p>This was also the sense I got from my fellow attendees. Chatting with people over lunch, or a beer later on, I was struck by just how many “Yeah, me too!” moments we had. It turns out that leading design is hard, but I’m reassured to know that people have the same problems as me.</p>\n<p>I was further reassured at the common themes that emerged over the event. It means we’re all on similar pages (or, at least we’re all reading the same book), and in an attempt to sift through those bits of knowledge that really spoke to me, here’s my top (sometimes badly paraphrased) common threads from the last three days. This is far-from all the messages that spoke to me, but this is the stuff that will have most immediate impact on my work:</p>\n<h2>Designing design</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://scottberkun.com/\">Scott Berkun</a>’s talk <em>Design vs. The World</em> started the conference on the right note with a big picture view of what it means to do design in the real world, and how it isn’t just pushing pixels around a screen. It got me thinking about my role, and how its increasingly solving problems that aren’t related to UI design, or writing CSS.</p>\n<p>Later, during the Q&amp;A session with <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/aboutthebbc/insidethebbc/managementstructure/biographies/whitney_julia/\">Julia Whitney</a> (BBC), <a href=\"http://www.dannyhearn.me/\">Danny Hearn</a> and <a href=\"https://www.markboulton.co.uk/\">Mark Boulton</a> (Monotype), it was said (with perhaps a hint of lamentation) that we’re no longer doing design at the coal-face, rather it’s our job to design the design experience: The environments and culture in which our teams works, and the processes they lean-on to get their work done.</p>\n<p>This really struck a chord with me.</p>\n<h2>Resistance is futile</h2>\n<p>Someone (I’m sorry I can’t remember who) included a slide of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borg_(Star_Trek)\">Locutus of Borg</a>, simultaneously making the point about assimilating into other team’s cultures, and scoring points with me for a Star Trek reference.</p>\n<p>In her talk <em>New on the Job: Your First 90 Days in a Design Leadership Role</em> <a href=\"http://pnts.us/\">Andrea Mignolo</a> talked about the “layer cake”, a delicious way to visualise the hierarchy in your company. She argued that you had to design the experience for each layer, to talk about design in the language of your audience.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/@ccourage\">Catherine Courage</a> said “Strive for shared empathy”, the points in the middle where you can meet and talk design in a way thats understandable by even the most numbers-driven business development manager.</p>\n<p>In both her talk and brilliant workshop <a href=\"http://www.practicallyux.com/\">Gail Swanson</a> taught us about presenting to decision makers. We used mapping techniques to better understand the drivers for those people from whom we seek approval. This is definitely a technique I’ll try at Firefly, to be able to frame an argument in a way that already fits in with the pressures and  priorities of others is incredibly powerful.</p>\n<h2>Dark matter</h2>\n<p>How do we quantify the value of design? Its difficult to ask quantitative questions when you’re dealing with solving problems on an emotional level. How would you measure a target like “Users feel 9% more engaged this quarter”? We don’t have the tools to measure qualitative data like this. And yet, this is the stuff that really adds value.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://nathan.com/\">Nathan Shedroff</a>’s talk <em>Using the Waveline: Mapping Premium Value to the User Journey (a new tool for planning deeper customer experiences)</em> detailed how to start to measure the emotional impact over time that your product or service has, and how this can be designed for maximum empathy.</p>\n<p>If you’re at all involved in designing anything for anyone (I would argue that’s everyone), then I’d recommend further reading into Nathan’s Waveline theories. It’s certainly something I’ll investigate further.</p>\n<h2>A quick note on the conference itself</h2>\n<p>Leading Design was perhaps the most useful, insightful and timely conference I’ve ever attended. Huge thanks to <a href=\"http://clearleft.com/is/andy-budd\">Andy Budd</a> et al for doing such a great job, and spotting the need for this event. You asked if we wanted another in 2017, its a resounding “yes” from me.</p>\n<p>The last thing I want to mention was the venue. I jumped a the chance for a tour of the Barbican during the lunch break the second day. If you’re a fan of brutalist architecture then this site is must-see. It was the perfect venue for a fantastic three days of conference.</p>\n","intro":"I’ve just spent three days at the Barbican enjoying the inaugural Leading Design Conference.

I think my biggest fear when I took the position was that I would no longer have much to offer. Increasingly I’d be taking on less and less of the day-to-day work, and without producing designs or churning out HTML what was I? Last year’s conference helped me to figure out at least some of what I should be doing with my days:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Designing team processes, environments and culture</li>\n<li>Protecting the team from too much work</li>\n<li>Evangelising design’s role in the company’s success</li>\n</ul>\n<p>My <a href=\"http://roobottom.com/articles/56/\">notes from last year</a> are a bit of a mess. This tells me that I hadn’t really fully understood what any of these new responsibilities were. In fact, its taken the last year for me to get a handle on what any of these mean for my working life. Was I doing a shitty job in the meantime? No, well, I certainly don’t think so. I just hadn’t fully appreciated that I’d taken the step out of a production role and into a leadership role and that I was completely unprepared for what that meant.</p>\n<p>The more I learn about design leadership, the more I realise that in most of the challenges you face every day, you can usually ditch the word <em>design</em>. Leadership is its own thing, a skill you have to be taught and then refine over time. Just because you can design doesn’t automatically mean you can lead a team of designers. Not something I was quick to pick up on.

Having being promoted the role of Head of Design fairly recently, I found the vast majority of the talks and both workshops extremely poignant.</p>\n<p>This was also the sense I got from my fellow attendees. Chatting with people over lunch, or a beer later on, I was struck by just how many “Yeah, me too!” moments we had. It turns out that leading design is hard, but I’m reassured to know that people have the same problems as me.</p>\n<p>I was further reassured at the common themes that emerged over the event. It means we’re all on similar pages (or, at least we’re all reading the same book), and in an attempt to sift through those bits of knowledge that really spoke to me, here’s my top (sometimes badly paraphrased) common threads from the last three days. This is far-from all the messages that spoke to me, but this is the stuff that will have most immediate impact on my work:</p>\n<h2>Designing design</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://scottberkun.com/\">Scott Berkun</a>’s talk <em>Design vs. The World</em> started the conference on the right note with a big picture view of what it means to do design in the real world, and how it isn’t just pushing pixels around a screen. It got me thinking about my role, and how its increasingly solving problems that aren’t related to UI design, or writing CSS.</p>\n<p>Later, during the Q&amp;A session with <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/aboutthebbc/insidethebbc/managementstructure/biographies/whitney_julia/\">Julia Whitney</a> (BBC), <a href=\"http://www.dannyhearn.me/\">Danny Hearn</a> and <a href=\"https://www.markboulton.co.uk/\">Mark Boulton</a> (Monotype), it was said (with perhaps a hint of lamentation) that we’re no longer doing design at the coal-face, rather it’s our job to design the design experience: The environments and culture in which our teams works, and the processes they lean-on to get their work done.</p>\n<p>This really struck a chord with me.</p>\n<h2>Resistance is futile</h2>\n<p>Someone (I’m sorry I can’t remember who) included a slide of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borg_(Star_Trek)\">Locutus of Borg</a>, simultaneously making the point about assimilating into other team’s cultures, and scoring points with me for a Star Trek reference.</p>\n<p>In her talk <em>New on the Job: Your First 90 Days in a Design Leadership Role</em> <a href=\"http://pnts.us/\">Andrea Mignolo</a> talked about the “layer cake”, a delicious way to visualise the hierarchy in your company. She argued that you had to design the experience for each layer, to talk about design in the language of your audience.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/@ccourage\">Catherine Courage</a> said “Strive for shared empathy”, the points in the middle where you can meet and talk design in a way thats understandable by even the most numbers-driven business development manager.</p>\n<p>In both her talk and brilliant workshop <a href=\"http://www.practicallyux.com/\">Gail Swanson</a> taught us about presenting to decision makers. We used mapping techniques to better understand the drivers for those people from whom we seek approval. This is definitely a technique I’ll try at Firefly, to be able to frame an argument in a way that already fits in with the pressures and  priorities of others is incredibly powerful.</p>\n<h2>Dark matter</h2>\n<p>How do we quantify the value of design? Its difficult to ask quantitative questions when you’re dealing with solving problems on an emotional level. How would you measure a target like “Users feel 9% more engaged this quarter”? We don’t have the tools to measure qualitative data like this. And yet, this is the stuff that really adds value.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://nathan.com/\">Nathan Shedroff</a>’s talk <em>Using the Waveline: Mapping Premium Value to the User Journey (a new tool for planning deeper customer experiences)</em> detailed how to start to measure the emotional impact over time that your product or service has, and how this can be designed for maximum empathy.</p>\n<p>If you’re at all involved in designing anything for anyone (I would argue that’s everyone), then I’d recommend further reading into Nathan’s Waveline theories. It’s certainly something I’ll investigate further.</p>\n<h2>A quick note on the conference itself</h2>\n<p>Leading Design was perhaps the most useful, insightful and timely conference I’ve ever attended. Huge thanks to <a href=\"http://clearleft.com/is/andy-budd\">Andy Budd</a> et al for doing such a great job, and spotting the need for this event. You asked if we wanted another in 2017, its a resounding “yes” from me.</p>\n<p>The last thing I want to mention was the venue. I jumped a the chance for a tour of the Barbican during the lunch break the second day. If you’re a fan of brutalist architecture then this site is must-see. It was the perfect venue for a fantastic three days of conference.</p>\n","intro":"I’ve just spent three days at the Barbican enjoying the inaugural Leading Design Conference.

Its obvious that were all thinking about patterns, and particularly how Sketch symbols have enabled a new workflow.</p>\n<p>Later, we moved on to a workshop session where we mapped out our design process and made a (long) list of all the tools we were currently using day-to-day.</p>\n  <figure data-width=\"\" data-height=\"\">      <img src=\"/images/articles/66/design-club-chapter-2.jpg\"/>            <figcaption>        Listing the tuna, members of the Design Club taking part in the workshop      </figcaption>        </figure>\n<p>What was clear is that there are a <em>lot</em> of design tools out there. Sketch is ubiquitous, having quickly proved its value against creaky Adobe tools. However, there’s a whole ecosystem of other tools that are designed to fill gaps in the designers workflow.</p>\n<p>Having both a design and front-end development background I feel like I’ve seen this all before. There have been several “revolutions” in web — <abbr title=\"Cascading Style Sheets\">CSS</abbr>, Responsiveness, HTMLinJS, etc —  that all gave rise to any number of tools that promised “more time doing what you love.”</p>\n<p>Some of these tools were flash in the pan: When they didn’t find traction amongst enough developers, they died. However, they each added their voices to the shared knowledge amongst developers on <em>how</em> to develop for the web.</p>\n<p>As it is now with design tools. Sure, some of them don’t really know what they’re trying to be, but can we blame them? We don’t know what we need right now. Ultimately what matters is the thinking behind patterns not how we build them.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, if you’re designing sites for the web or apps for devices, then eventually someone with a bit of coding nounce has to translate your designs into the real deal. Regardless of whether the ultimate destination of your design is HTML, Swift or <em>whatever</em>, I’d argue that designing with patterns in mind — no matter of the size of project — helps you think more like a developer. You’ll have better conversations with your developer friends and this will lead to a better experience for your users.</p>\n<p>Patterns is a way of thinking about design, rather than a set of tools. You could just as easily apply this thinking to MS Paint. But what the tools give us is a way to explore, as a community, what works best.</p>\n<p>I personally welcome the slew of tools even if they are pretty immature right now. There’s a really smart community of designers out there that’ll direct tool makers leading us all to a brighter future.

Designers have long had the idea of designing interfaces from a kit of pre-built parts, but never really had the tools to do this effectively. Sketch is such a tool.</p>\n<p>At Firefly, we made the transition to Sketch specifically because of the power of symbols. These have enabled us to build our pattern library in a way that helps us to do some extremely rapid prototyping and create consistent experiences for our users.</p>\n<p>Our Front-End and iOS teams already have their own pattern libraries. These are different, partly due to technical reasons, but there’s another reason we kept the patterns separate. As we continue to strive for feature parity between platforms, its obvious that there are some fundamental differences between web and iOS.  There is a <em>way</em> of doing things in iOS — interactions that users expect — that’s different from the web. Hence, web and iOS have the same features, but implemented in the way that makes the most sense to users of that platform.</p>\n<p>Our dream was to create two design pattern libraries that would contain the same elements as the web and iOS libraries. This would mean that we’d all be working from the same list of patterns, rather than adding a translation step when it came to implementation.</p>\n<h2>Structure</h2>\n<p>We studied the structure of the existing pattern libraries and created a map that included all patterns, their modifiers and states. This gave us the structure for our patterns, and a place to start from when translating programatic patterns into something that would be useable in Sketch.</p>\n<p>In simple terms, our pattern library is a number of Sketch files containing — as symbols — all the elements in the Firefly interface. We divide these into separate files, one for each platform. We’ve also broken web into web-core and one file for each of our <a href=\"http://themes.fireflylearning.com\">four core themes</a>.</p>\n<p>In each of the files, we’ve categorised our symbols into areas. This helps massively with your mental model when browsing the symbols page. This also allows us to print a visual style-guide of all our patterns.</p>\n<p>(figure set:categorising,class:poke-both)</p>\n<h2>Symbols</h2>\n<p>Sketch supports symbol nesting and overrides. This makes symbols extremely powerful. This allows you to create a pattern element by combining symbols together.</p>\n<p>However, organisation is everything. If you don’t follow a systematic approach to creating patterns, they’re extremely difficult to use in the wild. We know from experience that confusion arises about which symbols are patterns, and which are simply the building blocks of patterns. Let me explain…</p>\n<h3>Parts and Patterns</h3>\n<p>(figure set:button-anatomy,class:pull-right)</p>\n<p>A pattern is made up of either parts or other symbols. Each part is a symbol. A Button, for example, is made up of two parts <em>Background</em> and <em>Label</em>, and another pattern <em>Icon</em>. We use <a href=\"https://www.sketchapp.com/learn/documentation/symbols/organizing-symbols/\">slash notation</a> to organise parts and patterns under one namespace.</p>\n<p>(figure set:dropdown,class:poke-both)</p>\n<p>Organising our symbols this way makes it easy when using a pattern. It’s immediately obvious from the list of symbols which is a pattern that’s intended for use, and which are just the building blocks of patterns.</p>\n<h3>Using Patterns in the wild</h3>\n<p>When designing a new feature, we’ll start out with a blank sketch file. Let’s say, for example, that we wanted a very simple interface that required two buttons: OK and Cancel. OK needs to be a cancel type with a tick icon, and Cancel needs to be a default type with a cross icon.</p>\n<p>In our pattern library file, we have a page called <em>scratch</em> where we can set up a pattern ready to be copied into another file. We select the <code>Button &gt; Patterns &gt; Button with Icon Left</code> symbol from the list and drop it into our scratch page. We can then use the symbol overrides to change it’s Background, Icon and Label as required. We can also override the text.</p>\n<p>(figure set:using-a-symbol,class:poke-both)</p>\n<p>Once the pattern is set up, we can then copy this into the new document. This only copies the parts required for this instance of the pattern. So trying to change the symbol overrides in the new file won’t work until you copy over all variations of a pattern.</p>\n<h2>Tips ’n tricks</h2>\n<p>There’s a few areas where symbols are ripe for improvement. Given Bohemian’s track record for updates and bug fixes I suspect these can’t be too far off. Meantime, there’s a couple of workarounds that we’ve found particularly useful that I’d like to share.</p>\n<h3>Pin to corner</h3>\n<p>The ability to change resize behaviour in symbols is extremely useful. However, the “Pin to corner” option is somewhat limited as it doesn’t let you specify <em>which</em> corner.</p>\n<p>(figure set:pintocorner,class:pull-right)</p>\n<p>We solve this by simply grouping a transparent shape in with the layer we wish to align. This allows you pin to other corners than the one that Sketch might have automatically picked for you.</p>\n<h3>Override colours of icons</h3>\n<p>It’s annoying to have to have separate symbols for different icon colours. Especially when adding a new colour, meaning you have to create a new symbol for all the icons in the new colour.</p>\n<p>Luckily, we can use layer masks and overrides to easily add colour options. An Icon pattern is actually a grouped rectangle masked out by the icon shape. We are then able to control the icon type <em>and</em> colour from a pre-defined pallet of colours. Adding a new colour is as easy as adding a new icon mask symbol.</p>\n<p>(figure set:overridecolour,class:poke-both)</p>\n<p>Another small tip: Make your icons and masks different sizes, that way you won’t get shown all the icons and colours together in the overrides dropdown.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Sharing patterns</h2>\n<p>So far I’ve not really touched on how we’re using our pattern library across a team. An essential part of any pattern library is its use beyond a single person. When we set out to create our pattern library, we had a simple set of requirements:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Symbols should be stored in a central location that is accessible by the whole team</li>\n<li>Symbols can be linked across files, updating a symbol in any file updates it everywhere</li>\n<li>Editing clashes are handled in a nice way</li>\n<li>Symbols can be organised into categories</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>What we’re currently doing</h3>\n<p>Initially we experimented with <a href=\"https://www.invisionapp.com/craft\">Craft</a> from inVision. It’s library functionality would allow us to store symbols in a central location, share them across the team. Most excitingly of all, symbols would be linked across files, meaning we could ensure we were always using the latest version in our designs.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, when it came to handling editing clashes, Craft did less well. We lost an entire week of work due to our library file becoming corrupted. We were told that this was a known issue, and the file was unrecoverable. We decided not to entrust our entire pattern library to Craft, there was no way we could risk that happening again.</p>\n<p>We switched to using Sketch files themselves to contain our patterns. A downside to this solution was that editing clashes weren’t handled, at all. Rather, whoever saved the file last would overwrite work of anyone else. Thankfully, <a href=\"https://abstractapp.com/\">Abstract</a> came to our rescue.</p>\n<p>The team has been using Abstract for version management of Sketch files for the last few weeks, and what a difference it’s made! Once you have the git mental model in your head, Abstract’s workflow makes a lot of sense. We can now branch off the master pattern library document, make our changes, and merge back. Clashes are handled visually, giving you the choice of which symbol definition to keep.</p>\n<p>(figure set:abstarct,class:poke-both)</p>\n<p>We now have three out of four of our original requirements. We’re almost there! But what about linking symbols across files?</p>\n<h2>A native solution?</h2>\n<p>I’d argue that level of complexity represented by shared symbols in Sketch requires a native solution. Plugins, like Craft, will only ever be a poly-fill at best.</p>\n<p>Looking at the features that Bohemian have added to Sketch over the last few versions, I strongly suspect that they’re already planning shared symbols. It’s a natural fit for them, they already have the cloud infrastructure from Sketch Cloud and with their new open JSON formatted files, it seems like this might be the next logical step.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Are you looking for a new design challenge in London?

Let’s say, for example, that we wanted a very simple interface that required two buttons: OK and Cancel. OK needs to be a cancel type with a tick icon, and Cancel needs to be a default type with a cross icon.</p>\n<p>In our pattern library file, we have a page called <em>scratch</em> where we can set up a pattern ready to be copied into another file. We select the <code>Button &gt; Patterns &gt; Button with Icon Left</code> symbol from the list and drop it into our scratch page. We can then use the symbol overrides to change it’s Background, Icon and Label as required. We can also override the text.</p>\n<p>(figure set:using-a-symbol,class:poke-both)</p>\n<p>Once the pattern is set up, we can then copy this into the new document. This only copies the parts required for this instance of the pattern. So trying to change the symbol overrides in the new file won’t work until you copy over all variations of a pattern.</p>\n<h2>Tips ’n tricks</h2>\n<p>There’s a few areas where symbols are ripe for improvement. Given Bohemian’s track record for updates and bug fixes I suspect these can’t be too far off. Meantime, there’s a couple of workarounds that we’ve found particularly useful that I’d like to share.</p>\n<h3>Pin to corner</h3>\n<p>The ability to change resize behaviour in symbols is extremely useful. However, the “Pin to corner” option is somewhat limited as it doesn’t let you specify <em>which</em> corner.</p>\n<p>(figure set:pintocorner,class:pull-right)</p>\n<p>We solve this by simply grouping a transparent shape in with the layer we wish to align. This allows you pin to other corners than the one that Sketch might have automatically picked for you.</p>\n<h3>Override colours of icons</h3>\n<p>It’s annoying to have to have separate symbols for different icon colours. Especially when adding a new colour, meaning you have to create a new symbol for all the icons in the new colour.</p>\n<p>Luckily, we can use layer masks and overrides to easily add colour options. An Icon pattern is actually a grouped rectangle masked out by the icon shape. We are then able to control the icon type <em>and</em> colour from a pre-defined pallet of colours. Adding a new colour is as easy as adding a new icon mask symbol.</p>\n<p>(figure set:overridecolour,class:poke-both)</p>\n<p>Another small tip: Make your icons and masks different sizes, that way you won’t get shown all the icons and colours together in the overrides dropdown.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Sharing patterns</h2>\n<p>So far I’ve not really touched on how we’re using our pattern library across a team. An essential part of any pattern library is its use beyond a single person. When we set out to create our pattern library, we had a simple set of requirements:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Symbols should be stored in a central location that is accessible by the whole team</li>\n<li>Symbols can be linked across files, updating a symbol in any file updates it everywhere</li>\n<li>Editing clashes are handled in a nice way</li>\n<li>Symbols can be organised into categories</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>What we’re currently doing</h3>\n<p>Initially we experimented with <a href=\"https://www.invisionapp.com/craft\">Craft</a> from inVision. It’s library functionality would allow us to store symbols in a central location, share them across the team. Most excitingly of all, symbols would be linked across files, meaning we could ensure we were always using the latest version in our designs.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, when it came to handling editing clashes, Craft did less well. We lost an entire week of work due to our library file becoming corrupted. We were told that this was a known issue, and the file was unrecoverable. We decided not to entrust our entire pattern library to Craft, there was no way we could risk that happening again.</p>\n<p>We switched to using Sketch files themselves to contain our patterns. A downside to this solution was that editing clashes weren’t handled, at all. Rather, whoever saved the file last would overwrite work of anyone else. Thankfully, <a href=\"https://abstractapp.com/\">Abstract</a> came to our rescue.</p>\n<p>The team has been using Abstract for version management of Sketch files for the last few weeks, and what a difference it’s made! Once you have the git mental model in your head, Abstract’s workflow makes a lot of sense. We can now branch off the master pattern library document, make our changes, and merge back. Clashes are handled visually, giving you the choice of which symbol definition to keep.</p>\n<p>(figure set:abstarct,class:poke-both)</p>\n<p>We now have three out of four of our original requirements. We’re almost there! But what about linking symbols across files?</p>\n<h2>A native solution?</h2>\n<p>I’d argue that level of complexity represented by shared symbols in Sketch requires a native solution.

Designers have long had the idea of designing interfaces from a kit of pre-built parts, but never really had the tools to do this effectively. Sketch is such a tool.</p>\n<p>At Firefly, we made the transition to Sketch specifically because of the power of symbols. These have enabled us to build our pattern library in a way that helps us to do some extremely rapid prototyping and create consistent experiences for our users.</p>\n<p>Our Front-End and iOS teams already have their own pattern libraries. These are different, partly due to technical reasons, but there’s another reason we kept the patterns separate. As we continue to strive for feature parity between platforms, its obvious that there are some fundamental differences between web and iOS.  There is a <em>way</em> of doing things in iOS — interactions that users expect — that’s different from the web. Hence, web and iOS have the same features, but implemented in the way that makes the most sense to users of that platform.</p>\n<p>Our dream was to create two design pattern libraries that would contain the same elements as the web and iOS libraries. This would mean that we’d all be working from the same list of patterns, rather than adding a translation step when it came to implementation.</p>\n<h2>Structure</h2>\n<p>We studied the structure of the existing pattern libraries and created a map that included all patterns, their modifiers and states. This gave us the structure for our patterns, and a place to start from when translating programatic patterns into something that would be useable in Sketch.</p>\n<p>In simple terms, our pattern library is a number of Sketch files containing — as symbols — all the elements in the Firefly interface. We divide these into separate files, one for each platform. We’ve also broken web into web-core and one file for each of our <a href=\"http://themes.fireflylearning.com\">four core themes</a>.</p>\n<p>In each of the files, we’ve categorised our symbols into areas. This helps massively with your mental model when browsing the symbols page. This also allows us to print a visual style-guide of all our patterns.</p>\n<p>(figure set:categorising,class:poke-both)</p>\n<h2>Symbols</h2>\n<p>Sketch supports symbol nesting and overrides. This makes symbols extremely powerful. This allows you to create a pattern element by combining symbols together.</p>\n<p>However, organisation is everything. If you don’t follow a systematic approach to creating patterns, they’re extremely difficult to use in the wild.

Let me explain…</p>\n<h3>Parts and Patterns</h3>\n<p>(figure set:button-anatomy,class:pull-right)</p>\n<p>A pattern is made up of either parts or other symbols. Each part is a symbol.

Thrashing out ideas with paper and pen is a great way of capturing early ideas quickly with the minimum of fuss. Together with user research, sketching is among the first steps we take whenever we’re designing a new feature.</p>\n<p>We’re also constantly refining our processes, always on the lookout for more efficient ways to build better software that allow our users to perform the tasks they find most useful.</p>\n<p>We’ve recently started using some ideas from a methodology called <strong>Design Sprints</strong>. Although its still early days, I wanted to share our experience of (what I’m calling) Firefly-flavoured Design Sprints.</p>\n<p>(figure set:squad)</p>\n<h2>What is a design sprint?</h2>\n<p>The design sprint was developed by Jake Knapp from <a href=\"http://www.gv.com/sprint/\">Google Ventures</a>. In its full form, its a five day process for answering business questions through design. Its a way to fail early meaning you, <em>theoretically</em>, deliver something that works first time.</p>\n<p>Implicit in the process is the requirement to gather opinions from all areas of the business, not just the design team. Typically you might involve those with customer contact, for example the support or client-experience teams.

The mantra of “fail early” is especially useful as it helps us to stay agile in a fast-paced market place.</p>\n<p>We’ve always listened closely to what teachers, students and parents want, but understanding exactly what they’ll find genuinely useful is rather more difficult.</p>\n<p>A process like Design Sprints helps us get our ideas in-front of customers at the earliest possible opportunity, and find out if what we <em>think</em> they want is actually useful, without going through the long process of design, build and QA first.</p>\n<h2>Our experience</h2>\n<p>We already had a very well defined problem, namely how to give schools greater flexibility in their Firefly navigation. In the sprint we’d set out to design both the updated navigation and the administration interface that would allow site administrators to customise the menu.</p>\n<p>I ran the day, as the “facilitator”. Viviana, our product manager, was the “decider”. The Communications squad (a cross-discipline team who would be building the feature) were our sketching team.</p>\n<p>We used a number of the activities from the Design Sprints book, together with a mix of activities from elsewhere that we thought would enable us to solve this problem in a day.</p>\n<h3>Jobs to be done</h3>\n<p>Before the sprint, Viv created a list of <strong>jobs to be done</strong>. Based directly from feedback, these are a way to think about tasks that users want to achieve. They’re written in a way so as the focus is on the task rather than a particular technology or solution, an example of this might be:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When organising the school’s Firefly pages, I want to be able to divide pages into highly visible sections, so I can make it easier to find content that is relevant for students, parents and teachers and show off the content we have.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Sketching</h3>\n<p>We went through a number of sketching exercises, first creating quick low fidelity sketches to flesh-out some early ideas. Then we moved on to creating more detailed sketches that detailed a whole user journey.</p>\n<p>(figure set:sketching)</p>\n<h3>Arriving at a solution</h3>\n<p>After each of the team had taken it in turns to present their sketch, we moved onto a round of <strong>heat mapping</strong>. Everyone was given a set of 10 sticky dots and we’re told to stick one or two next to features they particularly liked from the sketches. In this way, standout features were highlighted by clusters of dots.</p>\n<p>(figure set:voting)</p>\n<p>Viv then lead a round of Q&amp;A where we’d discuss the standout features. As the decider, she then made the call on which features would progress to design stage. I noted these down as a set of requirements.</p>\n<p>Finally, we created a final set of sketches as a team (with one person designated as the “scribe”) that combined all the features into a coherent user journey.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>This type of small, well-defined problem <em>is</em> solvable in a day. What we didn’t do is square the circle, i.e., test our solution with users. That’s a definite problem. We plan on creating interactive prototypes during the design stage which we’ll test with teachers.</p>\n<p>I predict this won’t turn-up too many surprises as we’ve not deviated too far from an established pattern. But this is definitely worth thinking about earlier for more complex problems or brand-new features.</p>\n<p>On a practical level we were also able to refine the “short-sprint” process for the next time: Chopping out the bits that didn’t yield anything useful and providing better explanations around the bits that confused people.</p>\n<p>We would’ve also liked to invite some guest experts from other areas of the business, we’ll definitely do this next time.</p>\n<h2>Where next?</h2>\n<p>Finding a balance between the full methodology as set out in the book, and a process we can use many times in quick succession is tricky. Cherry-picking <em>is</em> something the book suggests: You can remove day five, and do testing as a separate process without the need for the whole team. However, we deconstructed the sprint to its bare-bones, and I’m not convinced we didn’t loose… <em>something</em>.</p>\n<p>But, Firefly-flavoured Design Sprints are definitely here to stay. We’ve already booked-in longer sprints to help us solve slightly bigger problems, and allow us to include more of the methodology. We’ll refine them over time, cherry-picking the bits that work best for us.</p>\n<p>The culture of fail-early is one that we’re committed to. At the heart of this is getting features into the hands of clients as early as possible, listening to their feedback, and quickly delivering the next iteration. Design Sprints are just one way of doing this.</p>\n","intro":"Sketching has always been essential part of what we do at Firefly.

This time I’m going to talk about some the front-end technology and practices we used to help us build more robust software.</p>\n<h2>We built a pattern library</h2>\n<p>Until Firefly 6, it was usual practice to build features one-by-one. There was little re-use of code, meaning if we found a bug with an element, then we’d have to fix it multiple times.</p>\n<p>What we needed was a pattern library! In October we were joined for a few days by Anna Debenham who literally wrote the book on <a href=\"http://www.maban.co.uk/projects/front-end-style-guides/\">front-end style guides</a> to help us catalogue Firefly’s user interface.</p>\n<p>(figure set:anna)</p>\n<p>We used this to build a “single source of truth” library of interface elements. This means that Firefly is now essentially built from a kit of parts. If we need a button, we can just call one in from the library. Even better, if we find a bug with the button, we can fix it once, and its fixed everywhere. Much faster and a lot more robust.</p>\n<p>I also have to mention <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniellehuntrods/\">Danielle Huntrods</a>, a contractor who worked with us for almost a year, during which she built the majority of the of the pattern library. It was her brilliance that gave us such a solid foundation for the future.</p>\n<p>We plan (at some point) to release a publicly accessible version of the pattern library. This is part of our ongoing commitment to openness and giving back to the web community. Hopefully others will find what we’ve done useful.</p>\n<h2>We flattened the cascade</h2>\n<p>Cascading Style Sheets, or CSS, is the language that allows us to define the visual appearance of web pages. Firefly uses quite a lot of it.</p>\n<p>CSS uses something called a “Cascade”, meaning that elements can inherit their style from other elements that use the same HTML. For example:</p>\n<pre><code>button {\n    background-color: blue;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Means all <code>button</code> elements on the page would have a blue background.</p>\n<p>However if you wanted to make one red, you can give it a name, and use that name in the CSS to override the background colour to red. Useful and straightforward enough.</p>\n<p>However, The problem with this comes when you have thousands of elements. Sometimes, when you style one element, because of the way CSS cascades, you inadvertently style another element you didn’t mean to.</p>\n<p>We solve this at Firefly by using a way of writing CSS called BEM, or Block Element Modifier. This allows us to effectively remove the cascade by using a naming system that guarantees that  you only ever style the specific element you meant to.</p>\n<p>This is great for us at Firefly, as it means we ship far less styling bugs. And it makes it easy for us to fix those bugs that do slip through, knowing that we’re not going to accidentally  cause more bugs elsewhere.</p>\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/\">read more about BEM here</a>, on the excellent CSS Tricks website.</p>\n<h2>We became more Reactive</h2>\n<p>Firefly makes heavy use of the other great language of the web: Javascript. This is the technology that allows us to manipulate the interface in real-time, without having to reload the page every time you take any action within Firefly.</p>\n<p>To help us write better Javascript, we’ve stared using a library called <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/react/\">React</a>. React was developed by Facebook to solve some of the challenges they were facing when building their website.</p>\n<p>To understand why this is good for Firefly, lets look at a practical example of a feature we introduced in Firefly 5: The Markbook.</p>\n<p>The Markbook is a highly interactive screen with lots of different states. We use Javascript to manage these states. However, this is where things get complicated very quickly. The developer must remember to update <em>all</em> the states when the user interacts with <em>any</em> of the states.</p>\n<p>For example, opening one popup will need to close any others. As you add more and more states, this compounds the problem. This is the source of many bugs, as developers can’t keep all these things in their heads all at once.</p>\n<p>(figure set:markbook)</p>\n<p>React manages states for you, by keeping its own internal copy of the page’s HTML, (what’s known as the Document Object Model, or DOM). It continually compares <em>its</em> model  to the real DOM that’s shown to the user, and updates it on the fly.</p>\n<p>In this way, things like closing one popup when another is opening can be controlled by one simple rule, and React handles the rest. This is leads to less bugs and happier users.</p>\n<p>We make use of React in the new Task Details screen, where teachers can mark student’s work in a variety of ways. This screen has hundreds of different states, all managed reliably by React.</p>\n<h2>We simplified our themes offering</h2>\n<p>This was perhaps the most controversial changes we made with made in Firefly 6. We did this to improve the user experience of the majority of users in Firefly, but quite understandably some schools were disgruntled when they discovered that we were retiring Columnist and Angular. We were also removed support for a number of custom themes we’d built for some of our long-standing clients.</p>\n<h3>Fewer bugs</h3>\n<p>Themes have always been the source of front-end bugs within Firefly. Each theme has its own HTML with which it “wraps” standard Firefly elements (like resource page content, or the Markbook for example). It also has its own CSS with which it will restyle the standard Firefly elements.</p>\n<p>This means that when we release new feature or updates existing ones, we also have to update the themes. The more themes, the more updates we have to do. Obviously, this model doesn’t scale well. So we’ve reduced the number of themes we offer to ensure that when we release updates, we can ensure that all our schools have a great experience.</p>\n<h3>Theme Variables</h3>\n<p>What about theme customisation? Many schools want to inject their personality into the tools they use every day. In Firefly 5 we introduced <strong>Theme Variables</strong> to do just this. We improved them in Firefly 6 (more about that later), but its worth covering the basics:</p>\n<p>Firefly uses a CSS pre-processor called <em><a href=\"http://lesscss.org/\">Less</a></em>. This allows us to store colours as variables, and manipulate them programatically. For example, Melody has a variable called <code>@background-colour</code>, thats used in different places throughout the interface. <em>Less</em> allows you to use an array of <a href=\"http://lesscss.org/functions/#color-operations\">colour operation functions</a> to do things like darken or lighten colours. This is particularly useful for creating a harmonious colour scheme.</p>\n<p>We also use <em>Less</em> to check the relative contrast between two colours. For example, lets say we have a box, styled like this:</p>\n<pre><code>.box {\n    background-colour: @background-colour;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>We’d want to check that any text that’s put inside that box is legible. We can do this with <em>Less</em> by checking the contrast of two alternative colours <em>against</em> a background colour, and using the one which is most legible, like so:</p>\n<pre><code>.box {\n    background-colour: @background-colour;\n    color: contrast(@background-colour, black, white);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>All of which means that, per school, we can override these core variables with school colours, and be assured that the interface will still look great, and all text will be legible.</p>\n<h3>Better theme options</h3>\n<p>We’ve done a lot of work in Firefly 6 to improve and streamline the Theme Variables. Each theme now only requires a small set of colours. Every other colour used within the interface is based-off this core set.</p>\n<p>We’ve also removed a number of theme options that weren’t really adding much value for schools. For instance, lots of schools told us that they didn’t really care about things like background patterns, or changing fonts. We now use smart defaults instead.</p>\n<p>We’ve paved the way to style more of the interface based-off the schools’ colour choices in the future, all in a way that will work with feature updates we make.</p>\n<h2>Wrapping up</h2>\n<p>I hope you’ve found these couple of articles interesting. We like to be as open as possible about the way we build software. Hopefully this has given you an insight into the internal workings here at Firefly, and the things we’ve done to ensure we’re delivering the absolute best product possible.</p>\n","intro":"This is part two of a two part article all about building Firefly 6 and the lessons we learned along the way.","humanDate":{"dayName":"Monday","day":"23rd","month":"January","year":"2017","date":"Monday, January 23rd 2017","season":"Winter"},"next":{"title":"Design sprints at Firefly","url":"4","date":"2017-02-13T00:00:00.000Z"},"prev":{"title":"The road to Firefly 6, part 1","url":"2","date":"2017-01-16T00:00:00.000Z"}},{"title":"The road to Firefly 6, part 1","date":"2017-01-16T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["Firefly","design"],"images":[{"image":"big-red-button.jpg","caption":"Robin, Viv and I gather around the beautifully designed button to activate Firefly 6 in our offices in Hammersmith, 12th December 2016","set":"A"},{"image":"me-user-testing.jpg","caption":"Me doing some user testing at the Firefly Learning Conference in Birmingham, November 2016","set":"testing"},{"image":"sketching.jpg","caption":"An early sketch from a sketching workshop we ran at  the Firefly offices","set":"testing"},{"image":"team-firefly.jpg","caption":"Almost all of Team Firefly at the Firefly Learning Conference in Birmingham, 15th November 2016","set":"team"},{"image":"office-1.jpg","caption":"Firefly’s new offices at the Aircraft Factory, Hammersmith.","set":"office"},{"image":"office-2.jpg","caption":"Joe’s old Raleigh Firefly bike in pride of place at the Firefly offices in Hammersmith, October 2016","set":"office"}],"url":"2","content":"<p>Recently, Robin, Viv and I had the honour of pushing the (literal) big red button that would enable our clients to upgrade to Firefly 6. Champaign corks were popped and pizza was enjoyed by the whole team before we, very quickly, very diligently, returned to work.</p>\n<p>(figure set:A)</p>\n<p>Now seems like a good point to pause, and look back on the past eighteen months and the changes we made to our team, technology and working practices that enabled us to release the biggest step-change in Firefly to date.</p>\n<p>I’ve broken this article into two parts: This first part starts with journey in time from the deep dark past of April 2015 right up to the present day. We learned a lot about <em>how</em> to build great software in this time, so I’ll talk about that at the end.</p>\n<p>In part two (spoiler alert) I’ll talk about the changes we made to our technology stack and our design and front-end development teams.</p>\n<h2>Spring/Summer 2015</h2>\n<p>Back in April 2015 we knew <em>roughly</em> what teachers, students and parents wanted from the next version of Firefly. However, there was still lots of work to do to refine our ideas into a definite, focused list of features that would work for everyone.</p>\n<p>As Head of Product, Viv ran a number of discovery workshops with teachers, students and parents from a large number of our schools. Armed with this research, our UX team was able to start sketching solutions from which we could create interactive product mock-ups. These were then tested with more users, refined, and tested again.</p>\n<p>(figure set:testing)</p>\n<p>We didn’t just limit this discovery phase to the start of the project, we continued to conduct user research at every stage. We’re lucky that our clients don’t mind acting as guinea pigs and let us test all our crazy new ideas on them. We also engaged an agency to connect with non-client teachers, students and parents, to ensure that the new features would work for everyone, not just those used to Firefly already.</p>\n<h2>Autumn/Winter 2015</h2>\n<p>While research and design were progressing nicely, thoughts turned to a busy conference season. With the Firefly Learning Conference just around the corner and Bett looming, we knew we needed something more tangible than interactive mock-ups to show people.</p>\n<p>Bett, in particular, would be the first time clients and prospects alike could get hands-on with the new Firefly. We had to build a demo version of Firefly that would work well enough to give prospective clients a taste of what was to come in Firefly 6, that would also be robust enough to work with the WiFi in the ExCel centre.</p>\n<p>In a sterling effort by all involved, we cut a demo-ready version of Firefly less than 24 hours before the start of the show. Despite there being a few bits of hidden sticky-tape and string holding everything together, we had an amazingly successful Bett. The demo stood up to anyting our stand visitors threw at it, and I think its fair to say that everyone was suitably wowed.</p>\n<h2>Spring/Summer 2016</h2>\n<p>At the Firefly Learning Conference in November we’d confidently told our clients that they could expect Firefly 6 in the summer term. By the spring it was apparent that we couldn’t meet this deadline and release a version of Firefly that was of sufficient quality. So we took the difficult decision to delay the release to the next logical point where schools would have a chance to install it in-between terms: Christmas.</p>\n<p>In the summer we we’re able to release the new navigation, and because it was now in the hands of schools quickly iterate it based on feedback from a large group of users. As with all changes, it was met with a mixed reception, but the vast majority of users loved the changes we’d made.</p>\n<h2>Autumn/Winter 2016</h2>\n<p>We were now nearing the end of our development phase. A significant portion of both the web app and native iOS and Android apps had now been completed. We were on target for our completion date of 28th November, which would give us 2 weeks to do final testing before launch on 12th December.</p>\n<p>Building software is hard; Building great software is very hard. So it was understandable that the final few weeks before our production deadline was filled with late nights and many take-outs in the office.</p>\n<p>It is a testament to the diligent work of everyone involved that we brought this incredible new version in on time. Not just the team who built the software, but also the support, client experience, sales and marketing teams. They’re all responsible in equal part for Firefly 6.</p>\n<p>(figure set:team,class:span-both)</p>\n<h2>Please release me, let me go</h2>\n<p>Even the most old school software companies release their software more often than every 18 months, so why did we take a year-and-a-half to release Firefly 6?</p>\n<p>Well, the reality is that we were releasing, every two weeks in fact. We shipped <strong>35</strong> versions from <code>5.2.1</code> in April 2015 to <code>6.0.1</code> on 12th December 2016. These releases included a large number of bug fixes, and lots of new features and tweaks to existing features.</p>\n<p>So why was 6 such a big release? Well, this was such a step change that there were several Epics that wouldn’t make sense in isolation. For example, the new <em>Set A Task</em> flow allows teachers to create rich tasks with far more flexibility than tasks they could create in Firefly 5. Releasing this without any ability for students to respond to these tasks, or teachers then to mark the response was simply unfeasible.</p>\n<h2>Things we learned and changes we made</h2>\n<p>We’ve certainly have learned a thing or two along the way, not least that we need more development resource, but having just landing the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/15/firefly-takes-5-6m-series-a-for-its-learning-support-platform-for-schools/\">largest Series A investment</a> in Education Technology in the UK, we’re certainly now in a position to do that.</p>\n<p>It wouldn’t have been possible to build such complex software with a relatively small team without some smart ways of working. Over the last year-and-a-half we’ve made some big changes to the way we work, these help us work faster and release less bugs.</p>\n<h3>We established Epics, Squads and Guilds</h3>\n<p>We spilt sets of features up into logic chunks. These, we call <strong>Epics</strong>. An Epic is a set of features that makes sense end-to-end. For example, the new task setting flow was a single Epic. This included all the backend logic, and user interface elements for teachers, parents and students.</p>\n<p>Each Epic is owned by team called a <strong>Squad</strong>. A Squad is a self contained unit of UX’ers, Designers, Developers and a manager. Everyone who’s needed to research, design, build, refine and manage workflow for that one Epic.</p>\n<p>There are parts of the product that are relevant to more than one Squad. For example, the Pattern Library is used by all squads working on the Firefly web interface. To manage changes and updates to these areas we have <strong>Guilds</strong>. Typically a Guild will contain a representative from each Squad, and meet on an ad-hoc basis when changes are needed.</p>\n<h3>We moved</h3>\n<p>It would be remiss of me not to mention our new office. In October we moved from Lyric Square to the Aircraft Factory, in Hammersmith. We now have an amazing space that feels far more attuned to building brilliant software. We even have Joe’s old Raleigh Firefly bike (the inspiration for the name) in pride of place above his desk.</p>\n<p>(figure set:office)</p>\n<h3>We established the Nine Rules</h3>\n<p>I think what we’ve learned can be distilled into a set of principles that we’ve refined throughout this project. These are <strong>Firefly’s Nine Rules:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Frequent tasks should be easy and occasional tasks achievable</strong>. Teachers are incredibly busy, don’t give them a vast array of options.</li>\n<li><strong>Use smart defaults.</strong> We make good choices, so users don’t have to.</li>\n<li><strong>Don’t make me think.</strong> Make the next action obvious and unambiguous. Reduce unnecessary choices.</li>\n<li><strong>Beautiful by default.</strong> Teachers want to be proud of the things they create, so make this easy for them,</li>\n<li><strong>Optimise.</strong> Firefly should be fast.</li>\n<li><strong>Do less.</strong> Firefly should do a core set of things extremely well.</li>\n<li><strong>Design for teaching, not content management.</strong> Firefly isn’t a content management system, its a learning tool.</li>\n<li><strong>Right feature at the right moment.</strong> Too many options are confusing, be smart about when we expose a new feature.</li>\n<li><strong>Firefly isn’t just used in school</strong> Users should be able to achieve their task, no matter their location.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Where next?</h3>\n<p>Its an exciting time for Firefly. We’re expanding our team, and we’re brimming with ideas for the future. We’re working closely with a wide array of our clients to shape the next iteration of Firefly. There won’t be a large release for a while, but that’s exciting in itself, it means we’re going to work on smaller features that we can get into your hands quicker. I, for one, can’t wait to see what the next eighteen months brings.</p>\n","intro":"Recently, Robin, Viv and I had the honour of pushing the (literal) big red button that would enable our clients to upgrade to Firefly 6.

Although its still early days, I wanted to share our experience of (what I’m calling) Firefly-flavoured Design Sprints.</p>\n<p>(figure set:squad)</p>\n<h2>What is a design sprint?</h2>\n<p>The design sprint was developed by Jake Knapp from <a href=\"http://www.gv.com/sprint/\">Google Ventures</a>. In its full form, its a five day process for answering business questions through design. Its a way to fail early meaning you, <em>theoretically</em>, deliver something that works first time.</p>\n<p>Implicit in the process is the requirement to gather opinions from all areas of the business, not just the design team. Typically you might involve those with customer contact, for example the support or client-experience teams. You may also invite an expert from finance and marketing as well as members from the tech and design teams.</p>\n<p>A plan for the week might look like this:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr><th>Day</th><th>Outline</th></tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td>Monday</td><td>Understanding the challenge and decide what problem you’re trying to solve</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Tuesday</td><td>A number of different sketching activities to fully explore potential solutions</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Wednesday</td><td>The whole team presents and votes on solutions from Tuesday.</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Thursday</td><td>Creating a prototype of a chosen solution.</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Friday</td><td>Testing your prototype with real users and gathering feedback.</td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>What’s the benefit for Firefly?</h2>\n<p>We’ve been getting excited about Design Sprints for a while. The mantra of “fail early” is especially useful as it helps us to stay agile in a fast-paced market place.</p>\n<p>We’ve always listened closely to what teachers, students and parents want, but understanding exactly what they’ll find genuinely useful is rather more difficult.</p>\n<p>A process like Design Sprints helps us get our ideas in-front of customers at the earliest possible opportunity, and find out if what we <em>think</em> they want is actually useful, without going through the long process of design, build and QA first.</p>\n<h2>Our experience</h2>\n<p>We already had a very well defined problem, namely how to give schools greater flexibility in their Firefly navigation. In the sprint we’d set out to design both the updated navigation and the administration interface that would allow site administrators to customise the menu.</p>\n<p>I ran the day, as the “facilitator”. Viviana, our product manager, was the “decider”. The Communications squad (a cross-discipline team who would be building the feature) were our sketching team.</p>\n<p>We used a number of the activities from the Design Sprints book, together with a mix of activities from elsewhere that we thought would enable us to solve this problem in a day.</p>\n<h3>Jobs to be done</h3>\n<p>Before the sprint, Viv created a list of <strong>jobs to be done</strong>. Based directly from feedback, these are a way to think about tasks that users want to achieve. They’re written in a way so as the focus is on the task rather than a particular technology or solution, an example of this might be:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When organising the school’s Firefly pages, I want to be able to divide pages into highly visible sections, so I can make it easier to find content that is relevant for students, parents and teachers and show off the content we have.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Sketching</h3>\n<p>We went through a number of sketching exercises, first creating quick low fidelity sketches to flesh-out some early ideas. Then we moved on to creating more detailed sketches that detailed a whole user journey.</p>\n<p>(figure set:sketching)</p>\n<h3>Arriving at a solution</h3>\n<p>After each of the team had taken it in turns to present their sketch, we moved onto a round of <strong>heat mapping</strong>. Everyone was given a set of 10 sticky dots and we’re told to stick one or two next to features they particularly liked from the sketches. In this way, standout features were highlighted by clusters of dots.</p>\n<p>(figure set:voting)</p>\n<p>Viv then lead a round of Q&amp;A where we’d discuss the standout features. As the decider, she then made the call on which features would progress to design stage. I noted these down as a set of requirements.</p>\n<p>Finally, we created a final set of sketches as a team (with one person designated as the “scribe”) that combined all the features into a coherent user journey.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>This type of small, well-defined problem <em>is</em> solvable in a day. What we didn’t do is square the circle, i.e., test our solution with users. That’s a definite problem. We plan on creating interactive prototypes during the design stage which we’ll test with teachers.</p>\n<p>I predict this won’t turn-up too many surprises as we’ve not deviated too far from an established pattern. But this is definitely worth thinking about earlier for more complex problems or brand-new features.</p>\n<p>On a practical level we were also able to refine the “short-sprint” process for the next time: Chopping out the bits that didn’t yield anything useful and providing better explanations around the bits that confused people.</p>\n<p>We would’ve also liked to invite some guest experts from other areas of the business, we’ll definitely do this next time.</p>\n<h2>Where next?</h2>\n<p>Finding a balance between the full methodology as set out in the book, and a process we can use many times in quick succession is tricky. Cherry-picking <em>is</em> something the book suggests: You can remove day five, and do testing as a separate process without the need for the whole team. However, we deconstructed the sprint to its bare-bones, and I’m not convinced we didn’t loose… <em>something</em>.</p>\n<p>But, Firefly-flavoured Design Sprints are definitely here to stay. We’ve already booked-in longer sprints to help us solve slightly bigger problems, and allow us to include more of the methodology. We’ll refine them over time, cherry-picking the bits that work best for us.</p>\n<p>The culture of fail-early is one that we’re committed to. At the heart of this is getting features into the hands of clients as early as possible, listening to their feedback, and quickly delivering the next iteration. Design Sprints are just one way of doing this.</p>\n","intro":"Sketching has always been essential part of what we do at Firefly.

Hosted by the fine folks from <a href=\"https://clearleft.com/\">Clearleft</a> the event is now in its second year.</p>\n<p>Before last year’s event, I was still trying to figure out what my job was, let alone how to do it well. I think my biggest fear when I took the position was that I would no longer have much to offer. Increasingly I’d be taking on less and less of the day-to-day work, and without producing designs or churning out HTML what was I? Last year’s conference helped me to figure out at least some of what I should be doing with my days:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Designing team processes, environments and culture</li>\n<li>Protecting the team from too much work</li>\n<li>Evangelising design’s role in the company’s success</li>\n</ul>\n<p>My <a href=\"http://roobottom.com/articles/56/\">notes from last year</a> are a bit of a mess. This tells me that I hadn’t really fully understood what any of these new responsibilities were. In fact, its taken the last year for me to get a handle on what any of these mean for my working life. Was I doing a shitty job in the meantime? No, well, I certainly don’t think so. I just hadn’t fully appreciated that I’d taken the step out of a production role and into a leadership role and that I was completely unprepared for what that meant.</p>\n<p>The more I learn about design leadership, the more I realise that in most of the challenges you face every day, you can usually ditch the word <em>design</em>. Leadership is its own thing, a skill you have to be taught and then refine over time. Just because you can design doesn’t automatically mean you can lead a team of designers. Not something I was quick to pick up on. My advice for new design leaders is to realise that you’re unprepared for this new challenge and to cut yourself some slack when things inevitably go wrong.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>This year, I kept a page at the front of my notebook titled “Overall thoughts” and whenever I heard common themes that struck a chord, I wrote them down:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Things go wrong for everyone, no team is perfect, not even those with 100s of designs and huge budgets</li>\n<li>No-one in your company knows what design leadership is. Spend more time with other design leaders</li>\n<li>Be the “shit umbrella” — protect your team</li>\n<li>Managing designers is hard (although, I’d change this to managing people is hard)</li>\n<li>Strategic partnership is a must. Strive to understand how you can help others in your company solve problems by understanding their point of view</li>\n<li>Take the time to understand your business, not just the role of design within it</li>\n<li>Ask obvious questions, it’s a safe bet that your not the only one who doesn’t understand</li>\n</ul>\n<p>My thoughts on design leadership continue to evolve. I don’t think I’ll ever get to a point where I can write a comprehensive list of what makes a good Head of Design. Like anything, you get better at it over time. There’s always more to be learned, and always some way to be better at your job.</p>\n<p>I do think it’s important to keep evaluating and striving to be better. And, of course, events like Leading Design give you time to step back from the coalface and formulate your thoughts.</p>\n","intro":"I spent some of last week listening to some great design leaders share their thoughts at Leading Design 2017.

Sketch is ubiquitous, having quickly proved its value against creaky Adobe tools. However, there’s a whole ecosystem of other tools that are designed to fill gaps in the designers workflow.</p>\n<p>Having both a design and front-end development background I feel like I’ve seen this all before.

Sure, some of them don’t really know what they’re trying to be, but can we blame them? We don’t know what we need right now. Ultimately what matters is the thinking behind patterns not how we build them.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, if you’re designing sites for the web or apps for devices, then eventually someone with a bit of coding nounce has to translate your designs into the real deal. Regardless of whether the ultimate destination of your design is HTML, Swift or <em>whatever</em>, I’d argue that designing with patterns in mind — no matter of the size of project — helps you think more like a developer. You’ll have better conversations with your developer friends and this will lead to a better experience for your users.</p>\n<p>Patterns is a way of thinking about design, rather than a set of tools. You could just as easily apply this thinking to MS Paint. But what the tools give us is a way to explore, as a community, what works best.</p>\n<p>I personally welcome the slew of tools even if they are pretty immature right now. There’s a really smart community of designers out there that’ll direct tool makers leading us all to a brighter future.

Designers have long had the idea of designing interfaces from a kit of pre-built parts, but never really had the tools to do this effectively. Sketch is such a tool.</p>\n<p>At Firefly, we made the transition to Sketch specifically because of the power of symbols. These have enabled us to build our pattern library in a way that helps us to do some extremely rapid prototyping and create consistent experiences for our users.</p>\n<p>Our Front-End and iOS teams already have their own pattern libraries. These are different, partly due to technical reasons, but there’s another reason we kept the patterns separate. As we continue to strive for feature parity between platforms, its obvious that there are some fundamental differences between web and iOS.  There is a <em>way</em> of doing things in iOS — interactions that users expect — that’s different from the web. Hence, web and iOS have the same features, but implemented in the way that makes the most sense to users of that platform.</p>\n<p>Our dream was to create two design pattern libraries that would contain the same elements as the web and iOS libraries. This would mean that we’d all be working from the same list of patterns, rather than adding a translation step when it came to implementation.</p>\n<h2>Structure</h2>\n<p>We studied the structure of the existing pattern libraries and created a map that included all patterns, their modifiers and states. This gave us the structure for our patterns, and a place to start from when translating programatic patterns into something that would be useable in Sketch.</p>\n<p>In simple terms, our pattern library is a number of Sketch files containing — as symbols — all the elements in the Firefly interface. We divide these into separate files, one for each platform. We’ve also broken web into web-core and one file for each of our <a href=\"http://themes.fireflylearning.com\">four core themes</a>.</p>\n<p>In each of the files, we’ve categorised our symbols into areas. This helps massively with your mental model when browsing the symbols page. This also allows us to print a visual style-guide of all our patterns.</p>\n<p>(figure set:categorising,class:poke-both)</p>\n<h2>Symbols</h2>\n<p>Sketch supports symbol nesting and overrides. This makes symbols extremely powerful. This allows you to create a pattern element by combining symbols together.</p>\n<p>However, organisation is everything. If you don’t follow a systematic approach to creating patterns, they’re extremely difficult to use in the wild. We know from experience that confusion arises about which symbols are patterns, and which are simply the building blocks of patterns. Let me explain…</p>\n<h3>Parts and Patterns</h3>\n<p>(figure set:button-anatomy,class:pull-right)</p>\n<p>A pattern is made up of either parts or other symbols. Each part is a symbol. A Button, for example, is made up of two parts <em>Background</em> and <em>Label</em>, and another pattern <em>Icon</em>. We use <a href=\"https://www.sketchapp.com/learn/documentation/symbols/organizing-symbols/\">slash notation</a> to organise parts and patterns under one namespace.</p>\n<p>(figure set:dropdown,class:poke-both)</p>\n<p>Organising our symbols this way makes it easy when using a pattern. It’s immediately obvious from the list of symbols which is a pattern that’s intended for use, and which are just the building blocks of patterns.</p>\n<h3>Using Patterns in the wild</h3>\n<p>When designing a new feature, we’ll start out with a blank sketch file. Let’s say, for example, that we wanted a very simple interface that required two buttons: OK and Cancel. OK needs to be a cancel type with a tick icon, and Cancel needs to be a default type with a cross icon.</p>\n<p>In our pattern library file, we have a page called <em>scratch</em> where we can set up a pattern ready to be copied into another file. We select the <code>Button &gt; Patterns &gt; Button with Icon Left</code> symbol from the list and drop it into our scratch page. We can then use the symbol overrides to change it’s Background, Icon and Label as required. We can also override the text.</p>\n<p>(figure set:using-a-symbol,class:poke-both)</p>\n<p>Once the pattern is set up, we can then copy this into the new document. This only copies the parts required for this instance of the pattern. So trying to change the symbol overrides in the new file won’t work until you copy over all variations of a pattern.</p>\n<h2>Tips ’n tricks</h2>\n<p>There’s a few areas where symbols are ripe for improvement. Given Bohemian’s track record for updates and bug fixes I suspect these can’t be too far off. Meantime, there’s a couple of workarounds that we’ve found particularly useful that I’d like to share.</p>\n<h3>Pin to corner</h3>\n<p>The ability to change resize behaviour in symbols is extremely useful. However, the “Pin to corner” option is somewhat limited as it doesn’t let you specify <em>which</em> corner.</p>\n<p>(figure set:pintocorner,class:pull-right)</p>\n<p>We solve this by simply grouping a transparent shape in with the layer we wish to align. This allows you pin to other corners than the one that Sketch might have automatically picked for you.</p>\n<h3>Override colours of icons</h3>\n<p>It’s annoying to have to have separate symbols for different icon colours. Especially when adding a new colour, meaning you have to create a new symbol for all the icons in the new colour.</p>\n<p>Luckily, we can use layer masks and overrides to easily add colour options. An Icon pattern is actually a grouped rectangle masked out by the icon shape. We are then able to control the icon type <em>and</em> colour from a pre-defined pallet of colours. Adding a new colour is as easy as adding a new icon mask symbol.</p>\n<p>(figure set:overridecolour,class:poke-both)</p>\n<p>Another small tip: Make your icons and masks different sizes, that way you won’t get shown all the icons and colours together in the overrides dropdown.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Sharing patterns</h2>\n<p>So far I’ve not really touched on how we’re using our pattern library across a team. An essential part of any pattern library is its use beyond a single person. When we set out to create our pattern library, we had a simple set of requirements:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Symbols should be stored in a central location that is accessible by the whole team</li>\n<li>Symbols can be linked across files, updating a symbol in any file updates it everywhere</li>\n<li>Editing clashes are handled in a nice way</li>\n<li>Symbols can be organised into categories</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>What we’re currently doing</h3>\n<p>Initially we experimented with <a href=\"https://www.invisionapp.com/craft\">Craft</a> from inVision. It’s library functionality would allow us to store symbols in a central location, share them across the team. Most excitingly of all, symbols would be linked across files, meaning we could ensure we were always using the latest version in our designs.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, when it came to handling editing clashes, Craft did less well. We lost an entire week of work due to our library file becoming corrupted. We were told that this was a known issue, and the file was unrecoverable. We decided not to entrust our entire pattern library to Craft, there was no way we could risk that happening again.</p>\n<p>We switched to using Sketch files themselves to contain our patterns. A downside to this solution was that editing clashes weren’t handled, at all. Rather, whoever saved the file last would overwrite work of anyone else. Thankfully, <a href=\"https://abstractapp.com/\">Abstract</a> came to our rescue.</p>\n<p>The team has been using Abstract for version management of Sketch files for the last few weeks, and what a difference it’s made! Once you have the git mental model in your head, Abstract’s workflow makes a lot of sense. We can now branch off the master pattern library document, make our changes, and merge back. Clashes are handled visually, giving you the choice of which symbol definition to keep.</p>\n<p>(figure set:abstarct,class:poke-both)</p>\n<p>We now have three out of four of our original requirements. We’re almost there! But what about linking symbols across files?</p>\n<h2>A native solution?</h2>\n<p>I’d argue that level of complexity represented by shared symbols in Sketch requires a native solution. Plugins, like Craft, will only ever be a poly-fill at best.</p>\n<p>Looking at the features that Bohemian have added to Sketch over the last few versions, I strongly suspect that they’re already planning shared symbols. It’s a natural fit for them, they already have the cloud infrastructure from Sketch Cloud and with their new open JSON formatted files, it seems like this might be the next logical step.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Are you looking for a new design challenge in London?

Although its still early days, I wanted to share our experience of (what I’m calling) Firefly-flavoured Design Sprints.</p>\n<p>(figure set:squad)</p>\n<h2>What is a design sprint?</h2>\n<p>The design sprint was developed by Jake Knapp from <a href=\"http://www.gv.com/sprint/\">Google Ventures</a>. In its full form, its a five day process for answering business questions through design. Its a way to fail early meaning you, <em>theoretically</em>, deliver something that works first time.</p>\n<p>Implicit in the process is the requirement to gather opinions from all areas of the business, not just the design team. Typically you might involve those with customer contact, for example the support or client-experience teams. You may also invite an expert from finance and marketing as well as members from the tech and design teams.</p>\n<p>A plan for the week might look like this:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr><th>Day</th><th>Outline</th></tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td>Monday</td><td>Understanding the challenge and decide what problem you’re trying to solve</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Tuesday</td><td>A number of different sketching activities to fully explore potential solutions</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Wednesday</td><td>The whole team presents and votes on solutions from Tuesday.</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Thursday</td><td>Creating a prototype of a chosen solution.</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Friday</td><td>Testing your prototype with real users and gathering feedback.</td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>What’s the benefit for Firefly?</h2>\n<p>We’ve been getting excited about Design Sprints for a while. The mantra of “fail early” is especially useful as it helps us to stay agile in a fast-paced market place.</p>\n<p>We’ve always listened closely to what teachers, students and parents want, but understanding exactly what they’ll find genuinely useful is rather more difficult.</p>\n<p>A process like Design Sprints helps us get our ideas in-front of customers at the earliest possible opportunity, and find out if what we <em>think</em> they want is actually useful, without going through the long process of design, build and QA first.</p>\n<h2>Our experience</h2>\n<p>We already had a very well defined problem, namely how to give schools greater flexibility in their Firefly navigation. In the sprint we’d set out to design both the updated navigation and the administration interface that would allow site administrators to customise the menu.</p>\n<p>I ran the day, as the “facilitator”. Viviana, our product manager, was the “decider”. The Communications squad (a cross-discipline team who would be building the feature) were our sketching team.</p>\n<p>We used a number of the activities from the Design Sprints book, together with a mix of activities from elsewhere that we thought would enable us to solve this problem in a day.</p>\n<h3>Jobs to be done</h3>\n<p>Before the sprint, Viv created a list of <strong>jobs to be done</strong>. Based directly from feedback, these are a way to think about tasks that users want to achieve. They’re written in a way so as the focus is on the task rather than a particular technology or solution, an example of this might be:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When organising the school’s Firefly pages, I want to be able to divide pages into highly visible sections, so I can make it easier to find content that is relevant for students, parents and teachers and show off the content we have.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Sketching</h3>\n<p>We went through a number of sketching exercises, first creating quick low fidelity sketches to flesh-out some early ideas. Then we moved on to creating more detailed sketches that detailed a whole user journey.</p>\n<p>(figure set:sketching)</p>\n<h3>Arriving at a solution</h3>\n<p>After each of the team had taken it in turns to present their sketch, we moved onto a round of <strong>heat mapping</strong>. Everyone was given a set of 10 sticky dots and we’re told to stick one or two next to features they particularly liked from the sketches. In this way, standout features were highlighted by clusters of dots.</p>\n<p>(figure set:voting)</p>\n<p>Viv then lead a round of Q&amp;A where we’d discuss the standout features. As the decider, she then made the call on which features would progress to design stage. I noted these down as a set of requirements.</p>\n<p>Finally, we created a final set of sketches as a team (with one person designated as the “scribe”) that combined all the features into a coherent user journey.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>This type of small, well-defined problem <em>is</em> solvable in a day. What we didn’t do is square the circle, i.e., test our solution with users. That’s a definite problem. We plan on creating interactive prototypes during the design stage which we’ll test with teachers.</p>\n<p>I predict this won’t turn-up too many surprises as we’ve not deviated too far from an established pattern. But this is definitely worth thinking about earlier for more complex problems or brand-new features.</p>\n<p>On a practical level we were also able to refine the “short-sprint” process for the next time: Chopping out the bits that didn’t yield anything useful and providing better explanations around the bits that confused people.</p>\n<p>We would’ve also liked to invite some guest experts from other areas of the business, we’ll definitely do this next time.</p>\n<h2>Where next?</h2>\n<p>Finding a balance between the full methodology as set out in the book, and a process we can use many times in quick succession is tricky. Cherry-picking <em>is</em> something the book suggests: You can remove day five, and do testing as a separate process without the need for the whole team. However, we deconstructed the sprint to its bare-bones, and I’m not convinced we didn’t loose… <em>something</em>.</p>\n<p>But, Firefly-flavoured Design Sprints are definitely here to stay. We’ve already booked-in longer sprints to help us solve slightly bigger problems, and allow us to include more of the methodology. We’ll refine them over time, cherry-picking the bits that work best for us.</p>\n<p>The culture of fail-early is one that we’re committed to. At the heart of this is getting features into the hands of clients as early as possible, listening to their feedback, and quickly delivering the next iteration.

This time I’m going to talk about some the front-end technology and practices we used to help us build more robust software.</p>\n<h2>We built a pattern library</h2>\n<p>Until Firefly 6, it was usual practice to build features one-by-one. There was little re-use of code, meaning if we found a bug with an element, then we’d have to fix it multiple times.</p>\n<p>What we needed was a pattern library! In October we were joined for a few days by Anna Debenham who literally wrote the book on <a href=\"http://www.maban.co.uk/projects/front-end-style-guides/\">front-end style guides</a> to help us catalogue Firefly’s user interface.</p>\n<p>(figure set:anna)</p>\n<p>We used this to build a “single source of truth” library of interface elements. This means that Firefly is now essentially built from a kit of parts. If we need a button, we can just call one in from the library. Even better, if we find a bug with the button, we can fix it once, and its fixed everywhere. Much faster and a lot more robust.</p>\n<p>I also have to mention <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniellehuntrods/\">Danielle Huntrods</a>, a contractor who worked with us for almost a year, during which she built the majority of the of the pattern library. It was her brilliance that gave us such a solid foundation for the future.</p>\n<p>We plan (at some point) to release a publicly accessible version of the pattern library. This is part of our ongoing commitment to openness and giving back to the web community. Hopefully others will find what we’ve done useful.</p>\n<h2>We flattened the cascade</h2>\n<p>Cascading Style Sheets, or CSS, is the language that allows us to define the visual appearance of web pages. Firefly uses quite a lot of it.</p>\n<p>CSS uses something called a “Cascade”, meaning that elements can inherit their style from other elements that use the same HTML. For example:</p>\n<pre><code>button {\n    background-color: blue;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Means all <code>button</code> elements on the page would have a blue background.</p>\n<p>However if you wanted to make one red, you can give it a name, and use that name in the CSS to override the background colour to red. Useful and straightforward enough.</p>\n<p>However, The problem with this comes when you have thousands of elements. Sometimes, when you style one element, because of the way CSS cascades, you inadvertently style another element you didn’t mean to.</p>\n<p>We solve this at Firefly by using a way of writing CSS called BEM, or Block Element Modifier. This allows us to effectively remove the cascade by using a naming system that guarantees that  you only ever style the specific element you meant to.</p>\n<p>This is great for us at Firefly, as it means we ship far less styling bugs. And it makes it easy for us to fix those bugs that do slip through, knowing that we’re not going to accidentally  cause more bugs elsewhere.</p>\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/\">read more about BEM here</a>, on the excellent CSS Tricks website.</p>\n<h2>We became more Reactive</h2>\n<p>Firefly makes heavy use of the other great language of the web: Javascript. This is the technology that allows us to manipulate the interface in real-time, without having to reload the page every time you take any action within Firefly.</p>\n<p>To help us write better Javascript, we’ve stared using a library called <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/react/\">React</a>. React was developed by Facebook to solve some of the challenges they were facing when building their website.</p>\n<p>To understand why this is good for Firefly, lets look at a practical example of a feature we introduced in Firefly 5: The Markbook.</p>\n<p>The Markbook is a highly interactive screen with lots of different states. We use Javascript to manage these states. However, this is where things get complicated very quickly. The developer must remember to update <em>all</em> the states when the user interacts with <em>any</em> of the states.</p>\n<p>For example, opening one popup will need to close any others. As you add more and more states, this compounds the problem. This is the source of many bugs, as developers can’t keep all these things in their heads all at once.</p>\n<p>(figure set:markbook)</p>\n<p>React manages states for you, by keeping its own internal copy of the page’s HTML, (what’s known as the Document Object Model, or DOM). It continually compares <em>its</em> model  to the real DOM that’s shown to the user, and updates it on the fly.</p>\n<p>In this way, things like closing one popup when another is opening can be controlled by one simple rule, and React handles the rest. This is leads to less bugs and happier users.</p>\n<p>We make use of React in the new Task Details screen, where teachers can mark student’s work in a variety of ways. This screen has hundreds of different states, all managed reliably by React.</p>\n<h2>We simplified our themes offering</h2>\n<p>This was perhaps the most controversial changes we made with made in Firefly 6. We did this to improve the user experience of the majority of users in Firefly, but quite understandably some schools were disgruntled when they discovered that we were retiring Columnist and Angular. We were also removed support for a number of custom themes we’d built for some of our long-standing clients.</p>\n<h3>Fewer bugs</h3>\n<p>Themes have always been the source of front-end bugs within Firefly. Each theme has its own HTML with which it “wraps” standard Firefly elements (like resource page content, or the Markbook for example). It also has its own CSS with which it will restyle the standard Firefly elements.</p>\n<p>This means that when we release new feature or updates existing ones, we also have to update the themes. The more themes, the more updates we have to do. Obviously, this model doesn’t scale well. So we’ve reduced the number of themes we offer to ensure that when we release updates, we can ensure that all our schools have a great experience.</p>\n<h3>Theme Variables</h3>\n<p>What about theme customisation? Many schools want to inject their personality into the tools they use every day. In Firefly 5 we introduced <strong>Theme Variables</strong> to do just this. We improved them in Firefly 6 (more about that later), but its worth covering the basics:</p>\n<p>Firefly uses a CSS pre-processor called <em><a href=\"http://lesscss.org/\">Less</a></em>. This allows us to store colours as variables, and manipulate them programatically. For example, Melody has a variable called <code>@background-colour</code>, thats used in different places throughout the interface. <em>Less</em> allows you to use an array of <a href=\"http://lesscss.org/functions/#color-operations\">colour operation functions</a> to do things like darken or lighten colours. This is particularly useful for creating a harmonious colour scheme.</p>\n<p>We also use <em>Less</em> to check the relative contrast between two colours. For example, lets say we have a box, styled like this:</p>\n<pre><code>.box {\n    background-colour: @background-colour;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>We’d want to check that any text that’s put inside that box is legible. We can do this with <em>Less</em> by checking the contrast of two alternative colours <em>against</em> a background colour, and using the one which is most legible, like so:</p>\n<pre><code>.box {\n    background-colour: @background-colour;\n    color: contrast(@background-colour, black, white);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>All of which means that, per school, we can override these core variables with school colours, and be assured that the interface will still look great, and all text will be legible.</p>\n<h3>Better theme options</h3>\n<p>We’ve done a lot of work in Firefly 6 to improve and streamline the Theme Variables. Each theme now only requires a small set of colours. Every other colour used within the interface is based-off this core set.</p>\n<p>We’ve also removed a number of theme options that weren’t really adding much value for schools. For instance, lots of schools told us that they didn’t really care about things like background patterns, or changing fonts. We now use smart defaults instead.</p>\n<p>We’ve paved the way to style more of the interface based-off the schools’ colour choices in the future, all in a way that will work with feature updates we make.</p>\n<h2>Wrapping up</h2>\n<p>I hope you’ve found these couple of articles interesting. We like to be as open as possible about the way we build software. Hopefully this has given you an insight into the internal workings here at Firefly, and the things we’ve done to ensure we’re delivering the absolute best product possible.</p>\n","intro":"This is part two of a two part article all about building Firefly 6 and the lessons we learned along the way.","humanDate":{"dayName":"Monday","day":"23rd","month":"January","year":"2017","date":"Monday, January 23rd 2017","season":"Winter"},"next":{"title":"Design sprints at Firefly","url":"4","date":"2017-02-13T00:00:00.000Z"},"prev":{"title":"The road to Firefly 6, part 1","url":"2","date":"2017-01-16T00:00:00.000Z"}},{"title":"The road to Firefly 6, part 1","date":"2017-01-16T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["Firefly","design"],"images":[{"image":"big-red-button.jpg","caption":"Robin, Viv and I gather around the beautifully designed button to activate Firefly 6 in our offices in Hammersmith, 12th December 2016","set":"A"},{"image":"me-user-testing.jpg","caption":"Me doing some user testing at the Firefly Learning Conference in Birmingham, November 2016","set":"testing"},{"image":"sketching.jpg","caption":"An early sketch from a sketching workshop we ran at  the Firefly offices","set":"testing"},{"image":"team-firefly.jpg","caption":"Almost all of Team Firefly at the Firefly Learning Conference in Birmingham, 15th November 2016","set":"team"},{"image":"office-1.jpg","caption":"Firefly’s new offices at the Aircraft Factory, Hammersmith.","set":"office"},{"image":"office-2.jpg","caption":"Joe’s old Raleigh Firefly bike in pride of place at the Firefly offices in Hammersmith, October 2016","set":"office"}],"url":"2","content":"<p>Recently, Robin, Viv and I had the honour of pushing the (literal) big red button that would enable our clients to upgrade to Firefly 6. Champaign corks were popped and pizza was enjoyed by the whole team before we, very quickly, very diligently, returned to work.</p>\n<p>(figure set:A)</p>\n<p>Now seems like a good point to pause, and look back on the past eighteen months and the changes we made to our team, technology and working practices that enabled us to release the biggest step-change in Firefly to date.</p>\n<p>I’ve broken this article into two parts: This first part starts with journey in time from the deep dark past of April 2015 right up to the present day. We learned a lot about <em>how</em> to build great software in this time, so I’ll talk about that at the end.</p>\n<p>In part two (spoiler alert) I’ll talk about the changes we made to our technology stack and our design and front-end development teams.</p>\n<h2>Spring/Summer 2015</h2>\n<p>Back in April 2015 we knew <em>roughly</em> what teachers, students and parents wanted from the next version of Firefly. However, there was still lots of work to do to refine our ideas into a definite, focused list of features that would work for everyone.</p>\n<p>As Head of Product, Viv ran a number of discovery workshops with teachers, students and parents from a large number of our schools. Armed with this research, our UX team was able to start sketching solutions from which we could create interactive product mock-ups. These were then tested with more users, refined, and tested again.</p>\n<p>(figure set:testing)</p>\n<p>We didn’t just limit this discovery phase to the start of the project, we continued to conduct user research at every stage. We’re lucky that our clients don’t mind acting as guinea pigs and let us test all our crazy new ideas on them. We also engaged an agency to connect with non-client teachers, students and parents, to ensure that the new features would work for everyone, not just those used to Firefly already.</p>\n<h2>Autumn/Winter 2015</h2>\n<p>While research and design were progressing nicely, thoughts turned to a busy conference season. With the Firefly Learning Conference just around the corner and Bett looming, we knew we needed something more tangible than interactive mock-ups to show people.</p>\n<p>Bett, in particular, would be the first time clients and prospects alike could get hands-on with the new Firefly. We had to build a demo version of Firefly that would work well enough to give prospective clients a taste of what was to come in Firefly 6, that would also be robust enough to work with the WiFi in the ExCel centre.</p>\n<p>In a sterling effort by all involved, we cut a demo-ready version of Firefly less than 24 hours before the start of the show. Despite there being a few bits of hidden sticky-tape and string holding everything together, we had an amazingly successful Bett. The demo stood up to anyting our stand visitors threw at it, and I think its fair to say that everyone was suitably wowed.</p>\n<h2>Spring/Summer 2016</h2>\n<p>At the Firefly Learning Conference in November we’d confidently told our clients that they could expect Firefly 6 in the summer term. By the spring it was apparent that we couldn’t meet this deadline and release a version of Firefly that was of sufficient quality. So we took the difficult decision to delay the release to the next logical point where schools would have a chance to install it in-between terms: Christmas.</p>\n<p>In the summer we we’re able to release the new navigation, and because it was now in the hands of schools quickly iterate it based on feedback from a large group of users. As with all changes, it was met with a mixed reception, but the vast majority of users loved the changes we’d made.</p>\n<h2>Autumn/Winter 2016</h2>\n<p>We were now nearing the end of our development phase. A significant portion of both the web app and native iOS and Android apps had now been completed. We were on target for our completion date of 28th November, which would give us 2 weeks to do final testing before launch on 12th December.</p>\n<p>Building software is hard; Building great software is very hard. So it was understandable that the final few weeks before our production deadline was filled with late nights and many take-outs in the office.</p>\n<p>It is a testament to the diligent work of everyone involved that we brought this incredible new version in on time. Not just the team who built the software, but also the support, client experience, sales and marketing teams. They’re all responsible in equal part for Firefly 6.</p>\n<p>(figure set:team,class:span-both)</p>\n<h2>Please release me, let me go</h2>\n<p>Even the most old school software companies release their software more often than every 18 months, so why did we take a year-and-a-half to release Firefly 6?</p>\n<p>Well, the reality is that we were releasing, every two weeks in fact. We shipped <strong>35</strong> versions from <code>5.2.1</code> in April 2015 to <code>6.0.1</code> on 12th December 2016. These releases included a large number of bug fixes, and lots of new features and tweaks to existing features.</p>\n<p>So why was 6 such a big release? Well, this was such a step change that there were several Epics that wouldn’t make sense in isolation. For example, the new <em>Set A Task</em> flow allows teachers to create rich tasks with far more flexibility than tasks they could create in Firefly 5. Releasing this without any ability for students to respond to these tasks, or teachers then to mark the response was simply unfeasible.</p>\n<h2>Things we learned and changes we made</h2>\n<p>We’ve certainly have learned a thing or two along the way, not least that we need more development resource, but having just landing the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/15/firefly-takes-5-6m-series-a-for-its-learning-support-platform-for-schools/\">largest Series A investment</a> in Education Technology in the UK, we’re certainly now in a position to do that.</p>\n<p>It wouldn’t have been possible to build such complex software with a relatively small team without some smart ways of working. Over the last year-and-a-half we’ve made some big changes to the way we work, these help us work faster and release less bugs.</p>\n<h3>We established Epics, Squads and Guilds</h3>\n<p>We spilt sets of features up into logic chunks. These, we call <strong>Epics</strong>. An Epic is a set of features that makes sense end-to-end. For example, the new task setting flow was a single Epic. This included all the backend logic, and user interface elements for teachers, parents and students.</p>\n<p>Each Epic is owned by team called a <strong>Squad</strong>. A Squad is a self contained unit of UX’ers, Designers, Developers and a manager. Everyone who’s needed to research, design, build, refine and manage workflow for that one Epic.</p>\n<p>There are parts of the product that are relevant to more than one Squad. For example, the Pattern Library is used by all squads working on the Firefly web interface. To manage changes and updates to these areas we have <strong>Guilds</strong>. Typically a Guild will contain a representative from each Squad, and meet on an ad-hoc basis when changes are needed.</p>\n<h3>We moved</h3>\n<p>It would be remiss of me not to mention our new office. In October we moved from Lyric Square to the Aircraft Factory, in Hammersmith. We now have an amazing space that feels far more attuned to building brilliant software. We even have Joe’s old Raleigh Firefly bike (the inspiration for the name) in pride of place above his desk.</p>\n<p>(figure set:office)</p>\n<h3>We established the Nine Rules</h3>\n<p>I think what we’ve learned can be distilled into a set of principles that we’ve refined throughout this project. These are <strong>Firefly’s Nine Rules:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Frequent tasks should be easy and occasional tasks achievable</strong>. Teachers are incredibly busy, don’t give them a vast array of options.</li>\n<li><strong>Use smart defaults.</strong> We make good choices, so users don’t have to.</li>\n<li><strong>Don’t make me think.</strong> Make the next action obvious and unambiguous. Reduce unnecessary choices.</li>\n<li><strong>Beautiful by default.</strong> Teachers want to be proud of the things they create, so make this easy for them,</li>\n<li><strong>Optimise.</strong> Firefly should be fast.</li>\n<li><strong>Do less.</strong> Firefly should do a core set of things extremely well.</li>\n<li><strong>Design for teaching, not content management.</strong> Firefly isn’t a content management system, its a learning tool.</li>\n<li><strong>Right feature at the right moment.</strong> Too many options are confusing, be smart about when we expose a new feature.</li>\n<li><strong>Firefly isn’t just used in school</strong> Users should be able to achieve their task, no matter their location.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Where next?</h3>\n<p>Its an exciting time for Firefly. We’re expanding our team, and we’re brimming with ideas for the future. We’re working closely with a wide array of our clients to shape the next iteration of Firefly. There won’t be a large release for a while, but that’s exciting in itself, it means we’re going to work on smaller features that we can get into your hands quicker. I, for one, can’t wait to see what the next eighteen months brings.</p>\n","intro":"Recently, Robin, Viv and I had the honour of pushing the (literal) big red button that would enable our clients to upgrade to Firefly 6.

Having being promoted the role of Head of Design fairly recently, I found the vast majority of the talks and both workshops extremely poignant.</p>\n<p>This was also the sense I got from my fellow attendees. Chatting with people over lunch, or a beer later on, I was struck by just how many “Yeah, me too!” moments we had. It turns out that leading design is hard, but I’m reassured to know that people have the same problems as me.</p>\n<p>I was further reassured at the common themes that emerged over the event. It means we’re all on similar pages (or, at least we’re all reading the same book), and in an attempt to sift through those bits of knowledge that really spoke to me, here’s my top (sometimes badly paraphrased) common threads from the last three days. This is far-from all the messages that spoke to me, but this is the stuff that will have most immediate impact on my work:</p>\n<h2>Designing design</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://scottberkun.com/\">Scott Berkun</a>’s talk <em>Design vs. The World</em> started the conference on the right note with a big picture view of what it means to do design in the real world, and how it isn’t just pushing pixels around a screen. It got me thinking about my role, and how its increasingly solving problems that aren’t related to UI design, or writing CSS.</p>\n<p>Later, during the Q&amp;A session with <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/aboutthebbc/insidethebbc/managementstructure/biographies/whitney_julia/\">Julia Whitney</a> (BBC), <a href=\"http://www.dannyhearn.me/\">Danny Hearn</a> and <a href=\"https://www.markboulton.co.uk/\">Mark Boulton</a> (Monotype), it was said (with perhaps a hint of lamentation) that we’re no longer doing design at the coal-face, rather it’s our job to design the design experience: The environments and culture in which our teams works, and the processes they lean-on to get their work done.</p>\n<p>This really struck a chord with me.</p>\n<h2>Resistance is futile</h2>\n<p>Someone (I’m sorry I can’t remember who) included a slide of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borg_(Star_Trek)\">Locutus of Borg</a>, simultaneously making the point about assimilating into other team’s cultures, and scoring points with me for a Star Trek reference.</p>\n<p>In her talk <em>New on the Job: Your First 90 Days in a Design Leadership Role</em> <a href=\"http://pnts.us/\">Andrea Mignolo</a> talked about the “layer cake”, a delicious way to visualise the hierarchy in your company. She argued that you had to design the experience for each layer, to talk about design in the language of your audience.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/@ccourage\">Catherine Courage</a> said “Strive for shared empathy”, the points in the middle where you can meet and talk design in a way thats understandable by even the most numbers-driven business development manager.</p>\n<p>In both her talk and brilliant workshop <a href=\"http://www.practicallyux.com/\">Gail Swanson</a> taught us about presenting to decision makers. We used mapping techniques to better understand the drivers for those people from whom we seek approval. This is definitely a technique I’ll try at Firefly, to be able to frame an argument in a way that already fits in with the pressures and  priorities of others is incredibly powerful.</p>\n<h2>Dark matter</h2>\n<p>How do we quantify the value of design? Its difficult to ask quantitative questions when you’re dealing with solving problems on an emotional level. How would you measure a target like “Users feel 9% more engaged this quarter”? We don’t have the tools to measure qualitative data like this. And yet, this is the stuff that really adds value.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://nathan.com/\">Nathan Shedroff</a>’s talk <em>Using the Waveline: Mapping Premium Value to the User Journey (a new tool for planning deeper customer experiences)</em> detailed how to start to measure the emotional impact over time that your product or service has, and how this can be designed for maximum empathy.</p>\n<p>If you’re at all involved in designing anything for anyone (I would argue that’s everyone), then I’d recommend further reading into Nathan’s Waveline theories. It’s certainly something I’ll investigate further.</p>\n<h2>A quick note on the conference itself</h2>\n<p>Leading Design was perhaps the most useful, insightful and timely conference I’ve ever attended. Huge thanks to <a href=\"http://clearleft.com/is/andy-budd\">Andy Budd</a> et al for doing such a great job, and spotting the need for this event. You asked if we wanted another in 2017, its a resounding “yes” from me.</p>\n<p>The last thing I want to mention was the venue. I jumped a the chance for a tour of the Barbican during the lunch break the second day. If you’re a fan of brutalist architecture then this site is must-see. It was the perfect venue for a fantastic three days of conference.</p>\n","intro":"I’ve just spent three days at the Barbican enjoying the inaugural Leading Design Conference.

Hosted by the fine folks from <a href=\"https://clearleft.com/\">Clearleft</a> the event is now in its second year.</p>\n<p>Before last year’s event, I was still trying to figure out what my job was, let alone how to do it well. I think my biggest fear when I took the position was that I would no longer have much to offer. Increasingly I’d be taking on less and less of the day-to-day work, and without producing designs or churning out HTML what was I? Last year’s conference helped me to figure out at least some of what I should be doing with my days:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Designing team processes, environments and culture</li>\n<li>Protecting the team from too much work</li>\n<li>Evangelising design’s role in the company’s success</li>\n</ul>\n<p>My <a href=\"http://roobottom.com/articles/56/\">notes from last year</a> are a bit of a mess. This tells me that I hadn’t really fully understood what any of these new responsibilities were. In fact, its taken the last year for me to get a handle on what any of these mean for my working life. Was I doing a shitty job in the meantime? No, well, I certainly don’t think so. I just hadn’t fully appreciated that I’d taken the step out of a production role and into a leadership role and that I was completely unprepared for what that meant.</p>\n<p>The more I learn about design leadership, the more I realise that in most of the challenges you face every day, you can usually ditch the word <em>design</em>. Leadership is its own thing, a skill you have to be taught and then refine over time. Just because you can design doesn’t automatically mean you can lead a team of designers. Not something I was quick to pick up on. My advice for new design leaders is to realise that you’re unprepared for this new challenge and to cut yourself some slack when things inevitably go wrong.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>This year, I kept a page at the front of my notebook titled “Overall thoughts” and whenever I heard common themes that struck a chord, I wrote them down:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Things go wrong for everyone, no team is perfect, not even those with 100s of designs and huge budgets</li>\n<li>No-one in your company knows what design leadership is. Spend more time with other design leaders</li>\n<li>Be the “shit umbrella” — protect your team</li>\n<li>Managing designers is hard (although, I’d change this to managing people is hard)</li>\n<li>Strategic partnership is a must. Strive to understand how you can help others in your company solve problems by understanding their point of view</li>\n<li>Take the time to understand your business, not just the role of design within it</li>\n<li>Ask obvious questions, it’s a safe bet that your not the only one who doesn’t understand</li>\n</ul>\n<p>My thoughts on design leadership continue to evolve. I don’t think I’ll ever get to a point where I can write a comprehensive list of what makes a good Head of Design. Like anything, you get better at it over time. There’s always more to be learned, and always some way to be better at your job.</p>\n<p>I do think it’s important to keep evaluating and striving to be better. And, of course, events like Leading Design give you time to step back from the coalface and formulate your thoughts.</p>\n","intro":"I spent some of last week listening to some great design leaders share their thoughts at Leading Design 2017.

Its obvious that were all thinking about patterns, and particularly how Sketch symbols have enabled a new workflow.</p>\n<p>Later, we moved on to a workshop session where we mapped out our design process and made a (long) list of all the tools we were currently using day-to-day.</p>\n  <figure data-width=\"\" data-height=\"\">      <img src=\"/images/articles/66/design-club-chapter-2.jpg\"/>            <figcaption>        Listing the tuna, members of the Design Club taking part in the workshop      </figcaption>        </figure>\n<p>What was clear is that there are a <em>lot</em> of design tools out there. Sketch is ubiquitous, having quickly proved its value against creaky Adobe tools. However, there’s a whole ecosystem of other tools that are designed to fill gaps in the designers workflow.</p>\n<p>Having both a design and front-end development background I feel like I’ve seen this all before.

Sure, some of them don’t really know what they’re trying to be, but can we blame them? We don’t know what we need right now.

Regardless of whether the ultimate destination of your design is HTML, Swift or <em>whatever</em>, I’d argue that designing with patterns in mind — no matter of the size of project — helps you think more like a developer. You’ll have better conversations with your developer friends and this will lead to a better experience for your users.</p>\n<p>Patterns is a way of thinking about design, rather than a set of tools. You could just as easily apply this thinking to MS Paint. But what the tools give us is a way to explore, as a community, what works best.</p>\n<p>I personally welcome the slew of tools even if they are pretty immature right now. There’s a really smart community of designers out there that’ll direct tool makers leading us all to a brighter future.

Designers have long had the idea of designing interfaces from a kit of pre-built parts, but never really had the tools to do this effectively. Sketch is such a tool.</p>\n<p>At Firefly, we made the transition to Sketch specifically because of the power of symbols. These have enabled us to build our pattern library in a way that helps us to do some extremely rapid prototyping and create consistent experiences for our users.</p>\n<p>Our Front-End and iOS teams already have their own pattern libraries. These are different, partly due to technical reasons, but there’s another reason we kept the patterns separate. As we continue to strive for feature parity between platforms, its obvious that there are some fundamental differences between web and iOS.  There is a <em>way</em> of doing things in iOS — interactions that users expect — that’s different from the web. Hence, web and iOS have the same features, but implemented in the way that makes the most sense to users of that platform.</p>\n<p>Our dream was to create two design pattern libraries that would contain the same elements as the web and iOS libraries. This would mean that we’d all be working from the same list of patterns, rather than adding a translation step when it came to implementation.</p>\n<h2>Structure</h2>\n<p>We studied the structure of the existing pattern libraries and created a map that included all patterns, their modifiers and states. This gave us the structure for our patterns, and a place to start from when translating programatic patterns into something that would be useable in Sketch.</p>\n<p>In simple terms, our pattern library is a number of Sketch files containing — as symbols — all the elements in the Firefly interface. We divide these into separate files, one for each platform. We’ve also broken web into web-core and one file for each of our <a href=\"http://themes.fireflylearning.com\">four core themes</a>.</p>\n<p>In each of the files, we’ve categorised our symbols into areas. This helps massively with your mental model when browsing the symbols page. This also allows us to print a visual style-guide of all our patterns.</p>\n<p>(figure set:categorising,class:poke-both)</p>\n<h2>Symbols</h2>\n<p>Sketch supports symbol nesting and overrides. This makes symbols extremely powerful. This allows you to create a pattern element by combining symbols together.</p>\n<p>However, organisation is everything. If you don’t follow a systematic approach to creating patterns, they’re extremely difficult to use in the wild. We know from experience that confusion arises about which symbols are patterns, and which are simply the building blocks of patterns. Let me explain…</p>\n<h3>Parts and Patterns</h3>\n<p>(figure set:button-anatomy,class:pull-right)</p>\n<p>A pattern is made up of either parts or other symbols. Each part is a symbol. A Button, for example, is made up of two parts <em>Background</em> and <em>Label</em>, and another pattern <em>Icon</em>. We use <a href=\"https://www.sketchapp.com/learn/documentation/symbols/organizing-symbols/\">slash notation</a> to organise parts and patterns under one namespace.</p>\n<p>(figure set:dropdown,class:poke-both)</p>\n<p>Organising our symbols this way makes it easy when using a pattern. It’s immediately obvious from the list of symbols which is a pattern that’s intended for use, and which are just the building blocks of patterns.</p>\n<h3>Using Patterns in the wild</h3>\n<p>When designing a new feature, we’ll start out with a blank sketch file. Let’s say, for example, that we wanted a very simple interface that required two buttons: OK and Cancel. OK needs to be a cancel type with a tick icon, and Cancel needs to be a default type with a cross icon.</p>\n<p>In our pattern library file, we have a page called <em>scratch</em> where we can set up a pattern ready to be copied into another file. We select the <code>Button &gt; Patterns &gt; Button with Icon Left</code> symbol from the list and drop it into our scratch page. We can then use the symbol overrides to change it’s Background, Icon and Label as required. We can also override the text.</p>\n<p>(figure set:using-a-symbol,class:poke-both)</p>\n<p>Once the pattern is set up, we can then copy this into the new document. This only copies the parts required for this instance of the pattern. So trying to change the symbol overrides in the new file won’t work until you copy over all variations of a pattern.</p>\n<h2>Tips ’n tricks</h2>\n<p>There’s a few areas where symbols are ripe for improvement. Given Bohemian’s track record for updates and bug fixes I suspect these can’t be too far off. Meantime, there’s a couple of workarounds that we’ve found particularly useful that I’d like to share.</p>\n<h3>Pin to corner</h3>\n<p>The ability to change resize behaviour in symbols is extremely useful. However, the “Pin to corner” option is somewhat limited as it doesn’t let you specify <em>which</em> corner.</p>\n<p>(figure set:pintocorner,class:pull-right)</p>\n<p>We solve this by simply grouping a transparent shape in with the layer we wish to align. This allows you pin to other corners than the one that Sketch might have automatically picked for you.</p>\n<h3>Override colours of icons</h3>\n<p>It’s annoying to have to have separate symbols for different icon colours. Especially when adding a new colour, meaning you have to create a new symbol for all the icons in the new colour.</p>\n<p>Luckily, we can use layer masks and overrides to easily add colour options. An Icon pattern is actually a grouped rectangle masked out by the icon shape. We are then able to control the icon type <em>and</em> colour from a pre-defined pallet of colours. Adding a new colour is as easy as adding a new icon mask symbol.</p>\n<p>(figure set:overridecolour,class:poke-both)</p>\n<p>Another small tip: Make your icons and masks different sizes, that way you won’t get shown all the icons and colours together in the overrides dropdown.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Sharing patterns</h2>\n<p>So far I’ve not really touched on how we’re using our pattern library across a team. An essential part of any pattern library is its use beyond a single person. When we set out to create our pattern library, we had a simple set of requirements:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Symbols should be stored in a central location that is accessible by the whole team</li>\n<li>Symbols can be linked across files, updating a symbol in any file updates it everywhere</li>\n<li>Editing clashes are handled in a nice way</li>\n<li>Symbols can be organised into categories</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>What we’re currently doing</h3>\n<p>Initially we experimented with <a href=\"https://www.invisionapp.com/craft\">Craft</a> from inVision. It’s library functionality would allow us to store symbols in a central location, share them across the team. Most excitingly of all, symbols would be linked across files, meaning we could ensure we were always using the latest version in our designs.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, when it came to handling editing clashes, Craft did less well. We lost an entire week of work due to our library file becoming corrupted. We were told that this was a known issue, and the file was unrecoverable. We decided not to entrust our entire pattern library to Craft, there was no way we could risk that happening again.</p>\n<p>We switched to using Sketch files themselves to contain our patterns. A downside to this solution was that editing clashes weren’t handled, at all. Rather, whoever saved the file last would overwrite work of anyone else. Thankfully, <a href=\"https://abstractapp.com/\">Abstract</a> came to our rescue.</p>\n<p>The team has been using Abstract for version management of Sketch files for the last few weeks, and what a difference it’s made! Once you have the git mental model in your head, Abstract’s workflow makes a lot of sense. We can now branch off the master pattern library document, make our changes, and merge back. Clashes are handled visually, giving you the choice of which symbol definition to keep.</p>\n<p>(figure set:abstarct,class:poke-both)</p>\n<p>We now have three out of four of our original requirements. We’re almost there! But what about linking symbols across files?</p>\n<h2>A native solution?</h2>\n<p>I’d argue that level of complexity represented by shared symbols in Sketch requires a native solution. Plugins, like Craft, will only ever be a poly-fill at best.</p>\n<p>Looking at the features that Bohemian have added to Sketch over the last few versions, I strongly suspect that they’re already planning shared symbols. It’s a natural fit for them, they already have the cloud infrastructure from Sketch Cloud and with their new open JSON formatted files, it seems like this might be the next logical step.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Are you looking for a new design challenge in London?

Together with user research, sketching is among the first steps we take whenever we’re designing a new feature.</p>\n<p>We’re also constantly refining our processes, always on the lookout for more efficient ways to build better software that allow our users to perform the tasks they find most useful.</p>\n<p>We’ve recently started using some ideas from a methodology called <strong>Design Sprints</strong>. Although its still early days, I wanted to share our experience of (what I’m calling) Firefly-flavoured Design Sprints.</p>\n<p>(figure set:squad)</p>\n<h2>What is a design sprint?</h2>\n<p>The design sprint was developed by Jake Knapp from <a href=\"http://www.gv.com/sprint/\">Google Ventures</a>. In its full form, its a five day process for answering business questions through design. Its a way to fail early meaning you, <em>theoretically</em>, deliver something that works first time.</p>\n<p>Implicit in the process is the requirement to gather opinions from all areas of the business, not just the design team. Typically you might involve those with customer contact, for example the support or client-experience teams. You may also invite an expert from finance and marketing as well as members from the tech and design teams.</p>\n<p>A plan for the week might look like this:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr><th>Day</th><th>Outline</th></tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td>Monday</td><td>Understanding the challenge and decide what problem you’re trying to solve</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Tuesday</td><td>A number of different sketching activities to fully explore potential solutions</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Wednesday</td><td>The whole team presents and votes on solutions from Tuesday.</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Thursday</td><td>Creating a prototype of a chosen solution.</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Friday</td><td>Testing your prototype with real users and gathering feedback.</td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>What’s the benefit for Firefly?</h2>\n<p>We’ve been getting excited about Design Sprints for a while. The mantra of “fail early” is especially useful as it helps us to stay agile in a fast-paced market place.</p>\n<p>We’ve always listened closely to what teachers, students and parents want, but understanding exactly what they’ll find genuinely useful is rather more difficult.</p>\n<p>A process like Design Sprints helps us get our ideas in-front of customers at the earliest possible opportunity, and find out if what we <em>think</em> they want is actually useful, without going through the long process of design, build and QA first.</p>\n<h2>Our experience</h2>\n<p>We already had a very well defined problem, namely how to give schools greater flexibility in their Firefly navigation. In the sprint we’d set out to design both the updated navigation and the administration interface that would allow site administrators to customise the menu.</p>\n<p>I ran the day, as the “facilitator”. Viviana, our product manager, was the “decider”. The Communications squad (a cross-discipline team who would be building the feature) were our sketching team.</p>\n<p>We used a number of the activities from the Design Sprints book, together with a mix of activities from elsewhere that we thought would enable us to solve this problem in a day.</p>\n<h3>Jobs to be done</h3>\n<p>Before the sprint, Viv created a list of <strong>jobs to be done</strong>. Based directly from feedback, these are a way to think about tasks that users want to achieve. They’re written in a way so as the focus is on the task rather than a particular technology or solution, an example of this might be:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When organising the school’s Firefly pages, I want to be able to divide pages into highly visible sections, so I can make it easier to find content that is relevant for students, parents and teachers and show off the content we have.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Sketching</h3>\n<p>We went through a number of sketching exercises, first creating quick low fidelity sketches to flesh-out some early ideas. Then we moved on to creating more detailed sketches that detailed a whole user journey.</p>\n<p>(figure set:sketching)</p>\n<h3>Arriving at a solution</h3>\n<p>After each of the team had taken it in turns to present their sketch, we moved onto a round of <strong>heat mapping</strong>. Everyone was given a set of 10 sticky dots and we’re told to stick one or two next to features they particularly liked from the sketches. In this way, standout features were highlighted by clusters of dots.</p>\n<p>(figure set:voting)</p>\n<p>Viv then lead a round of Q&amp;A where we’d discuss the standout features. As the decider, she then made the call on which features would progress to design stage. I noted these down as a set of requirements.</p>\n<p>Finally, we created a final set of sketches as a team (with one person designated as the “scribe”) that combined all the features into a coherent user journey.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>This type of small, well-defined problem <em>is</em> solvable in a day. What we didn’t do is square the circle, i.e., test our solution with users. That’s a definite problem. We plan on creating interactive prototypes during the design stage which we’ll test with teachers.</p>\n<p>I predict this won’t turn-up too many surprises as we’ve not deviated too far from an established pattern. But this is definitely worth thinking about earlier for more complex problems or brand-new features.</p>\n<p>On a practical level we were also able to refine the “short-sprint” process for the next time: Chopping out the bits that didn’t yield anything useful and providing better explanations around the bits that confused people.</p>\n<p>We would’ve also liked to invite some guest experts from other areas of the business, we’ll definitely do this next time.</p>\n<h2>Where next?</h2>\n<p>Finding a balance between the full methodology as set out in the book, and a process we can use many times in quick succession is tricky. Cherry-picking <em>is</em> something the book suggests: You can remove day five, and do testing as a separate process without the need for the whole team. However, we deconstructed the sprint to its bare-bones, and I’m not convinced we didn’t loose… <em>something</em>.</p>\n<p>But, Firefly-flavoured Design Sprints are definitely here to stay. We’ve already booked-in longer sprints to help us solve slightly bigger problems, and allow us to include more of the methodology. We’ll refine them over time, cherry-picking the bits that work best for us.</p>\n<p>The culture of fail-early is one that we’re committed to. At the heart of this is getting features into the hands of clients as early as possible, listening to their feedback, and quickly delivering the next iteration. Design Sprints are just one way of doing this.</p>\n","intro":"Sketching has always been essential part of what we do at Firefly.

This time I’m going to talk about some the front-end technology and practices we used to help us build more robust software.</p>\n<h2>We built a pattern library</h2>\n<p>Until Firefly 6, it was usual practice to build features one-by-one. There was little re-use of code, meaning if we found a bug with an element, then we’d have to fix it multiple times.</p>\n<p>What we needed was a pattern library! In October we were joined for a few days by Anna Debenham who literally wrote the book on <a href=\"http://www.maban.co.uk/projects/front-end-style-guides/\">front-end style guides</a> to help us catalogue Firefly’s user interface.</p>\n<p>(figure set:anna)</p>\n<p>We used this to build a “single source of truth” library of interface elements. This means that Firefly is now essentially built from a kit of parts. If we need a button, we can just call one in from the library. Even better, if we find a bug with the button, we can fix it once, and its fixed everywhere. Much faster and a lot more robust.</p>\n<p>I also have to mention <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniellehuntrods/\">Danielle Huntrods</a>, a contractor who worked with us for almost a year, during which she built the majority of the of the pattern library. It was her brilliance that gave us such a solid foundation for the future.</p>\n<p>We plan (at some point) to release a publicly accessible version of the pattern library. This is part of our ongoing commitment to openness and giving back to the web community. Hopefully others will find what we’ve done useful.</p>\n<h2>We flattened the cascade</h2>\n<p>Cascading Style Sheets, or CSS, is the language that allows us to define the visual appearance of web pages. Firefly uses quite a lot of it.</p>\n<p>CSS uses something called a “Cascade”, meaning that elements can inherit their style from other elements that use the same HTML. For example:</p>\n<pre><code>button {\n    background-color: blue;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Means all <code>button</code> elements on the page would have a blue background.</p>\n<p>However if you wanted to make one red, you can give it a name, and use that name in the CSS to override the background colour to red. Useful and straightforward enough.</p>\n<p>However, The problem with this comes when you have thousands of elements. Sometimes, when you style one element, because of the way CSS cascades, you inadvertently style another element you didn’t mean to.</p>\n<p>We solve this at Firefly by using a way of writing CSS called BEM, or Block Element Modifier. This allows us to effectively remove the cascade by using a naming system that guarantees that  you only ever style the specific element you meant to.</p>\n<p>This is great for us at Firefly, as it means we ship far less styling bugs. And it makes it easy for us to fix those bugs that do slip through, knowing that we’re not going to accidentally  cause more bugs elsewhere.</p>\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/\">read more about BEM here</a>, on the excellent CSS Tricks website.</p>\n<h2>We became more Reactive</h2>\n<p>Firefly makes heavy use of the other great language of the web: Javascript. This is the technology that allows us to manipulate the interface in real-time, without having to reload the page every time you take any action within Firefly.</p>\n<p>To help us write better Javascript, we’ve stared using a library called <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/react/\">React</a>. React was developed by Facebook to solve some of the challenges they were facing when building their website.</p>\n<p>To understand why this is good for Firefly, lets look at a practical example of a feature we introduced in Firefly 5: The Markbook.</p>\n<p>The Markbook is a highly interactive screen with lots of different states. We use Javascript to manage these states. However, this is where things get complicated very quickly. The developer must remember to update <em>all</em> the states when the user interacts with <em>any</em> of the states.</p>\n<p>For example, opening one popup will need to close any others. As you add more and more states, this compounds the problem. This is the source of many bugs, as developers can’t keep all these things in their heads all at once.</p>\n<p>(figure set:markbook)</p>\n<p>React manages states for you, by keeping its own internal copy of the page’s HTML, (what’s known as the Document Object Model, or DOM). It continually compares <em>its</em> model  to the real DOM that’s shown to the user, and updates it on the fly.</p>\n<p>In this way, things like closing one popup when another is opening can be controlled by one simple rule, and React handles the rest. This is leads to less bugs and happier users.</p>\n<p>We make use of React in the new Task Details screen, where teachers can mark student’s work in a variety of ways. This screen has hundreds of different states, all managed reliably by React.</p>\n<h2>We simplified our themes offering</h2>\n<p>This was perhaps the most controversial changes we made with made in Firefly 6. We did this to improve the user experience of the majority of users in Firefly, but quite understandably some schools were disgruntled when they discovered that we were retiring Columnist and Angular. We were also removed support for a number of custom themes we’d built for some of our long-standing clients.</p>\n<h3>Fewer bugs</h3>\n<p>Themes have always been the source of front-end bugs within Firefly. Each theme has its own HTML with which it “wraps” standard Firefly elements (like resource page content, or the Markbook for example). It also has its own CSS with which it will restyle the standard Firefly elements.</p>\n<p>This means that when we release new feature or updates existing ones, we also have to update the themes. The more themes, the more updates we have to do. Obviously, this model doesn’t scale well. So we’ve reduced the number of themes we offer to ensure that when we release updates, we can ensure that all our schools have a great experience.</p>\n<h3>Theme Variables</h3>\n<p>What about theme customisation? Many schools want to inject their personality into the tools they use every day. In Firefly 5 we introduced <strong>Theme Variables</strong> to do just this. We improved them in Firefly 6 (more about that later), but its worth covering the basics:</p>\n<p>Firefly uses a CSS pre-processor called <em><a href=\"http://lesscss.org/\">Less</a></em>. This allows us to store colours as variables, and manipulate them programatically. For example, Melody has a variable called <code>@background-colour</code>, thats used in different places throughout the interface. <em>Less</em> allows you to use an array of <a href=\"http://lesscss.org/functions/#color-operations\">colour operation functions</a> to do things like darken or lighten colours. This is particularly useful for creating a harmonious colour scheme.</p>\n<p>We also use <em>Less</em> to check the relative contrast between two colours. For example, lets say we have a box, styled like this:</p>\n<pre><code>.box {\n    background-colour: @background-colour;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>We’d want to check that any text that’s put inside that box is legible. We can do this with <em>Less</em> by checking the contrast of two alternative colours <em>against</em> a background colour, and using the one which is most legible, like so:</p>\n<pre><code>.box {\n    background-colour: @background-colour;\n    color: contrast(@background-colour, black, white);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>All of which means that, per school, we can override these core variables with school colours, and be assured that the interface will still look great, and all text will be legible.</p>\n<h3>Better theme options</h3>\n<p>We’ve done a lot of work in Firefly 6 to improve and streamline the Theme Variables. Each theme now only requires a small set of colours. Every other colour used within the interface is based-off this core set.</p>\n<p>We’ve also removed a number of theme options that weren’t really adding much value for schools. For instance, lots of schools told us that they didn’t really care about things like background patterns, or changing fonts. We now use smart defaults instead.</p>\n<p>We’ve paved the way to style more of the interface based-off the schools’ colour choices in the future, all in a way that will work with feature updates we make.</p>\n<h2>Wrapping up</h2>\n<p>I hope you’ve found these couple of articles interesting. We like to be as open as possible about the way we build software. Hopefully this has given you an insight into the internal workings here at Firefly, and the things we’ve done to ensure we’re delivering the absolute best product possible.</p>\n","intro":"This is part two of a two part article all about building Firefly 6 and the lessons we learned along the way.","humanDate":{"dayName":"Monday","day":"23rd","month":"January","year":"2017","date":"Monday, January 23rd 2017","season":"Winter"},"next":{"title":"Design sprints at Firefly","url":"4","date":"2017-02-13T00:00:00.000Z"},"prev":{"title":"The road to Firefly 6, part 1","url":"2","date":"2017-01-16T00:00:00.000Z"}},{"title":"The road to Firefly 6, part 1","date":"2017-01-16T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["Firefly","design"],"images":[{"image":"big-red-button.jpg","caption":"Robin, Viv and I gather around the beautifully designed button to activate Firefly 6 in our offices in Hammersmith, 12th December 2016","set":"A"},{"image":"me-user-testing.jpg","caption":"Me doing some user testing at the Firefly Learning Conference in Birmingham, November 2016","set":"testing"},{"image":"sketching.jpg","caption":"An early sketch from a sketching workshop we ran at  the Firefly offices","set":"testing"},{"image":"team-firefly.jpg","caption":"Almost all of Team Firefly at the Firefly Learning Conference in Birmingham, 15th November 2016","set":"team"},{"image":"office-1.jpg","caption":"Firefly’s new offices at the Aircraft Factory, Hammersmith.","set":"office"},{"image":"office-2.jpg","caption":"Joe’s old Raleigh Firefly bike in pride of place at the Firefly offices in Hammersmith, October 2016","set":"office"}],"url":"2","content":"<p>Recently, Robin, Viv and I had the honour of pushing the (literal) big red button that would enable our clients to upgrade to Firefly 6. Champaign corks were popped and pizza was enjoyed by the whole team before we, very quickly, very diligently, returned to work.</p>\n<p>(figure set:A)</p>\n<p>Now seems like a good point to pause, and look back on the past eighteen months and the changes we made to our team, technology and working practices that enabled us to release the biggest step-change in Firefly to date.</p>\n<p>I’ve broken this article into two parts: This first part starts with journey in time from the deep dark past of April 2015 right up to the present day. We learned a lot about <em>how</em> to build great software in this time, so I’ll talk about that at the end.</p>\n<p>In part two (spoiler alert) I’ll talk about the changes we made to our technology stack and our design and front-end development teams.</p>\n<h2>Spring/Summer 2015</h2>\n<p>Back in April 2015 we knew <em>roughly</em> what teachers, students and parents wanted from the next version of Firefly. However, there was still lots of work to do to refine our ideas into a definite, focused list of features that would work for everyone.</p>\n<p>As Head of Product, Viv ran a number of discovery workshops with teachers, students and parents from a large number of our schools. Armed with this research, our UX team was able to start sketching solutions from which we could create interactive product mock-ups. These were then tested with more users, refined, and tested again.</p>\n<p>(figure set:testing)</p>\n<p>We didn’t just limit this discovery phase to the start of the project, we continued to conduct user research at every stage. We’re lucky that our clients don’t mind acting as guinea pigs and let us test all our crazy new ideas on them. We also engaged an agency to connect with non-client teachers, students and parents, to ensure that the new features would work for everyone, not just those used to Firefly already.</p>\n<h2>Autumn/Winter 2015</h2>\n<p>While research and design were progressing nicely, thoughts turned to a busy conference season. With the Firefly Learning Conference just around the corner and Bett looming, we knew we needed something more tangible than interactive mock-ups to show people.</p>\n<p>Bett, in particular, would be the first time clients and prospects alike could get hands-on with the new Firefly. We had to build a demo version of Firefly that would work well enough to give prospective clients a taste of what was to come in Firefly 6, that would also be robust enough to work with the WiFi in the ExCel centre.</p>\n<p>In a sterling effort by all involved, we cut a demo-ready version of Firefly less than 24 hours before the start of the show. Despite there being a few bits of hidden sticky-tape and string holding everything together, we had an amazingly successful Bett. The demo stood up to anyting our stand visitors threw at it, and I think its fair to say that everyone was suitably wowed.</p>\n<h2>Spring/Summer 2016</h2>\n<p>At the Firefly Learning Conference in November we’d confidently told our clients that they could expect Firefly 6 in the summer term. By the spring it was apparent that we couldn’t meet this deadline and release a version of Firefly that was of sufficient quality. So we took the difficult decision to delay the release to the next logical point where schools would have a chance to install it in-between terms: Christmas.</p>\n<p>In the summer we we’re able to release the new navigation, and because it was now in the hands of schools quickly iterate it based on feedback from a large group of users. As with all changes, it was met with a mixed reception, but the vast majority of users loved the changes we’d made.</p>\n<h2>Autumn/Winter 2016</h2>\n<p>We were now nearing the end of our development phase. A significant portion of both the web app and native iOS and Android apps had now been completed. We were on target for our completion date of 28th November, which would give us 2 weeks to do final testing before launch on 12th December.</p>\n<p>Building software is hard; Building great software is very hard. So it was understandable that the final few weeks before our production deadline was filled with late nights and many take-outs in the office.</p>\n<p>It is a testament to the diligent work of everyone involved that we brought this incredible new version in on time. Not just the team who built the software, but also the support, client experience, sales and marketing teams. They’re all responsible in equal part for Firefly 6.</p>\n<p>(figure set:team,class:span-both)</p>\n<h2>Please release me, let me go</h2>\n<p>Even the most old school software companies release their software more often than every 18 months, so why did we take a year-and-a-half to release Firefly 6?</p>\n<p>Well, the reality is that we were releasing, every two weeks in fact. We shipped <strong>35</strong> versions from <code>5.2.1</code> in April 2015 to <code>6.0.1</code> on 12th December 2016. These releases included a large number of bug fixes, and lots of new features and tweaks to existing features.</p>\n<p>So why was 6 such a big release? Well, this was such a step change that there were several Epics that wouldn’t make sense in isolation. For example, the new <em>Set A Task</em> flow allows teachers to create rich tasks with far more flexibility than tasks they could create in Firefly 5. Releasing this without any ability for students to respond to these tasks, or teachers then to mark the response was simply unfeasible.</p>\n<h2>Things we learned and changes we made</h2>\n<p>We’ve certainly have learned a thing or two along the way, not least that we need more development resource, but having just landing the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/15/firefly-takes-5-6m-series-a-for-its-learning-support-platform-for-schools/\">largest Series A investment</a> in Education Technology in the UK, we’re certainly now in a position to do that.</p>\n<p>It wouldn’t have been possible to build such complex software with a relatively small team without some smart ways of working. Over the last year-and-a-half we’ve made some big changes to the way we work, these help us work faster and release less bugs.</p>\n<h3>We established Epics, Squads and Guilds</h3>\n<p>We spilt sets of features up into logic chunks. These, we call <strong>Epics</strong>. An Epic is a set of features that makes sense end-to-end. For example, the new task setting flow was a single Epic. This included all the backend logic, and user interface elements for teachers, parents and students.</p>\n<p>Each Epic is owned by team called a <strong>Squad</strong>. A Squad is a self contained unit of UX’ers, Designers, Developers and a manager. Everyone who’s needed to research, design, build, refine and manage workflow for that one Epic.</p>\n<p>There are parts of the product that are relevant to more than one Squad. For example, the Pattern Library is used by all squads working on the Firefly web interface. To manage changes and updates to these areas we have <strong>Guilds</strong>. Typically a Guild will contain a representative from each Squad, and meet on an ad-hoc basis when changes are needed.</p>\n<h3>We moved</h3>\n<p>It would be remiss of me not to mention our new office. In October we moved from Lyric Square to the Aircraft Factory, in Hammersmith. We now have an amazing space that feels far more attuned to building brilliant software. We even have Joe’s old Raleigh Firefly bike (the inspiration for the name) in pride of place above his desk.</p>\n<p>(figure set:office)</p>\n<h3>We established the Nine Rules</h3>\n<p>I think what we’ve learned can be distilled into a set of principles that we’ve refined throughout this project. These are <strong>Firefly’s Nine Rules:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Frequent tasks should be easy and occasional tasks achievable</strong>. Teachers are incredibly busy, don’t give them a vast array of options.</li>\n<li><strong>Use smart defaults.</strong> We make good choices, so users don’t have to.</li>\n<li><strong>Don’t make me think.</strong> Make the next action obvious and unambiguous. Reduce unnecessary choices.</li>\n<li><strong>Beautiful by default.</strong> Teachers want to be proud of the things they create, so make this easy for them,</li>\n<li><strong>Optimise.</strong> Firefly should be fast.</li>\n<li><strong>Do less.</strong> Firefly should do a core set of things extremely well.</li>\n<li><strong>Design for teaching, not content management.</strong> Firefly isn’t a content management system, its a learning tool.</li>\n<li><strong>Right feature at the right moment.</strong> Too many options are confusing, be smart about when we expose a new feature.</li>\n<li><strong>Firefly isn’t just used in school</strong> Users should be able to achieve their task, no matter their location.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Where next?</h3>\n<p>Its an exciting time for Firefly. We’re expanding our team, and we’re brimming with ideas for the future. We’re working closely with a wide array of our clients to shape the next iteration of Firefly. There won’t be a large release for a while, but that’s exciting in itself, it means we’re going to work on smaller features that we can get into your hands quicker. I, for one, can’t wait to see what the next eighteen months brings.</p>\n","intro":"Recently, Robin, Viv and I had the honour of pushing the (literal) big red button that would enable our clients to upgrade to Firefly 6.

Having being promoted the role of Head of Design fairly recently, I found the vast majority of the talks and both workshops extremely poignant.</p>\n<p>This was also the sense I got from my fellow attendees. Chatting with people over lunch, or a beer later on, I was struck by just how many “Yeah, me too!” moments we had. It turns out that leading design is hard, but I’m reassured to know that people have the same problems as me.</p>\n<p>I was further reassured at the common themes that emerged over the event. It means we’re all on similar pages (or, at least we’re all reading the same book), and in an attempt to sift through those bits of knowledge that really spoke to me, here’s my top (sometimes badly paraphrased) common threads from the last three days. This is far-from all the messages that spoke to me, but this is the stuff that will have most immediate impact on my work:</p>\n<h2>Designing design</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://scottberkun.com/\">Scott Berkun</a>’s talk <em>Design vs. The World</em> started the conference on the right note with a big picture view of what it means to do design in the real world, and how it isn’t just pushing pixels around a screen. It got me thinking about my role, and how its increasingly solving problems that aren’t related to UI design, or writing CSS.</p>\n<p>Later, during the Q&amp;A session with <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/aboutthebbc/insidethebbc/managementstructure/biographies/whitney_julia/\">Julia Whitney</a> (BBC), <a href=\"http://www.dannyhearn.me/\">Danny Hearn</a> and <a href=\"https://www.markboulton.co.uk/\">Mark Boulton</a> (Monotype), it was said (with perhaps a hint of lamentation) that we’re no longer doing design at the coal-face, rather it’s our job to design the design experience: The environments and culture in which our teams works, and the processes they lean-on to get their work done.</p>\n<p>This really struck a chord with me.</p>\n<h2>Resistance is futile</h2>\n<p>Someone (I’m sorry I can’t remember who) included a slide of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borg_(Star_Trek)\">Locutus of Borg</a>, simultaneously making the point about assimilating into other team’s cultures, and scoring points with me for a Star Trek reference.</p>\n<p>In her talk <em>New on the Job: Your First 90 Days in a Design Leadership Role</em> <a href=\"http://pnts.us/\">Andrea Mignolo</a> talked about the “layer cake”, a delicious way to visualise the hierarchy in your company. She argued that you had to design the experience for each layer, to talk about design in the language of your audience.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/@ccourage\">Catherine Courage</a> said “Strive for shared empathy”, the points in the middle where you can meet and talk design in a way thats understandable by even the most numbers-driven business development manager.</p>\n<p>In both her talk and brilliant workshop <a href=\"http://www.practicallyux.com/\">Gail Swanson</a> taught us about presenting to decision makers. We used mapping techniques to better understand the drivers for those people from whom we seek approval. This is definitely a technique I’ll try at Firefly, to be able to frame an argument in a way that already fits in with the pressures and  priorities of others is incredibly powerful.</p>\n<h2>Dark matter</h2>\n<p>How do we quantify the value of design? Its difficult to ask quantitative questions when you’re dealing with solving problems on an emotional level. How would you measure a target like “Users feel 9% more engaged this quarter”? We don’t have the tools to measure qualitative data like this. And yet, this is the stuff that really adds value.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://nathan.com/\">Nathan Shedroff</a>’s talk <em>Using the Waveline: Mapping Premium Value to the User Journey (a new tool for planning deeper customer experiences)</em> detailed how to start to measure the emotional impact over time that your product or service has, and how this can be designed for maximum empathy.</p>\n<p>If you’re at all involved in designing anything for anyone (I would argue that’s everyone), then I’d recommend further reading into Nathan’s Waveline theories. It’s certainly something I’ll investigate further.</p>\n<h2>A quick note on the conference itself</h2>\n<p>Leading Design was perhaps the most useful, insightful and timely conference I’ve ever attended. Huge thanks to <a href=\"http://clearleft.com/is/andy-budd\">Andy Budd</a> et al for doing such a great job, and spotting the need for this event. You asked if we wanted another in 2017, its a resounding “yes” from me.</p>\n<p>The last thing I want to mention was the venue. I jumped a the chance for a tour of the Barbican during the lunch break the second day. If you’re a fan of brutalist architecture then this site is must-see. It was the perfect venue for a fantastic three days of conference.</p>\n","intro":"I’ve just spent three days at the Barbican enjoying the inaugural Leading Design Conference.

I lead a long-term initiative to overhaul our process and tooling which lead to significant gains in our velocity and quality of output.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Carving up an interface into reusable patterns is <em>the</em> way of developing for the web. All the cool kids are doing it. The tools and technology are readily available to front-end engineers support this workflow. Componentisation is encouraged in front-end libraries like React and Angular and is now enjoying wider standardised adoption through the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/standards/techs/components#w3c_all\">Web Components</a> specification. Developers also enjoy flexible working in teams using version control tools like Git.</p>\n<p>Until recently, the software to support this workflow for designers has been rubbish. However, the introduction of Sketch symbols and libraries coupled with tools like Abstract has revolutionised the way we design for the web and native apps.</p>\n<p>At Firefly Learning, I lead a project to fully utilise these new tools to introduce vastly improved standardisation and speed into our design process.</p>\n<h2>The problem</h2>\n<p>Two years ago we were using Adobe Illustrator as our primary design tool; this presented some problems:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Interface elements had to be copied and pasted between designs to ensure consistency.</li>\n<li>If we updated styling for one component, we’d have to update it everywhere manually. Of course, the upshot of this is that we tended <em>not</em> to risk making changes.</li>\n<li>More than one designer working on the same file lead to those designers going temporality insane.</li>\n<li>We were using Adobe Illustrator as our primary design tool.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>During this time we also split the design and front-end teams; this meant we had to do a lot more exposition to aid the transition from design to build.</p>\n<h2>The solution, phase one</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/articles/5/\">For a bit more context, you can read about our first pattern library.</a></p>\n<p>In phase one we: introduced Sketch as our defacto design tool, built the first version of our pattern library and implemented version control.</p>\n<h3>Introducing Sketch</h3>\n<p>I was fearful when telling my team we were making the transition from Illustrator to Sketch. For all its faults, Illustrator is a tool they knew well, and we already had lots of interface elements we could copy-and-paste to save time in new projects. I knew if the transition was going to succeed, I had to prove Sketch would be a superior experience.</p>\n<p>I did two things to smooth the change. First, I created a demo project that I could use to showboat Sketch symbols; this was a big win, and the team could see immediate benefits.</p>\n<p>Second, we introduced Sketch slowly; using it over a couple of smaller projects first before making it our defacto design tool. I’m happy to say that this strategy worked too, and the team were soon merrily designing in Sketch full time.</p>\n<h3>Creating a Sketch pattern library</h3>\n<p>I’d like to say that, once we’d made the transition to Sketch, creating our pattern library was a leisurely affair. It wasn’t; honestly, it was a bit of a slog. There were a few false starts where we couldn’t agree on the best way to structure the symbols. Even when we did arrive at the <code>patterns</code> and <code>parts</code> convention, we discovered that using the symbols was painful resulting in yet another rewrite.</p>\n<p>At this time in early 2015, the design community wasn’t saying much about <em>how</em> to use Sketch symbols to build an extensive pattern library. Sure, we felt like pioneers, but that wasn’t helping team morale. What we needed was a map.</p>\n<p>I created an overview of all the existing front-end patterns and their states and modifiers. As a team, we categorised and rationalised them; this gave us the clear direction we needed.</p>\n<p>[Interactive map graphic?]</p>\n<h3>Sharing patterns</h3>\n<p>By this stage, we were using Abstract to version control our files. Although we still hadn’t figured out how to keep patterns in-sync across multiple projects. Although a couple of tools claimed to have the solution to this problem, none of them worked for us. In the end, we opted for the “manually check this is the latest version” approach. It wasn’t pretty, but it worked, and I felt reasonably sure that Sketch would release a native solution to this problem.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>The solution, phase two</h2>\n","intro":"In 2016, our visual design process at Firefly Learning was a bit of a mess.
