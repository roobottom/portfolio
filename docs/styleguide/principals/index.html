  <h1>Design Principals</h1>
  <h2>A pleasurable reading experience</h2>
<p>Communication <em>via</em> the written word is one of life’s great pleasures. It’s essential that the reading experience on this site is delightful. Good typography is crucial and should be considered first in all designs.</p>
<h2>Hand-drawn</h2>
<p>Simple hand-drawn illustrations should be used to communicate ideas more effectively. Drawings don’t have to be perfect, but they should be working hard to tell a story beyond the words they support.</p>
<h2>Design for development</h2>
<p>Making design decisions for ease of development means compromise. It means finding the sweet spot between the fine-grain control that a design tool like Sketch afford versus the limitations of HTML and CSS.</p>
<h2>Be bold but concise</h2>
<p>In copy, use plain English and always put the most reverent details first.</p>
<p>In design, use big blocks and bright colours.</p>
<h2>Tactile</h2>
<p>This site should <em>feel</em> pleasing to navigate. Interactions should be as satisfying as interacting with real-world objects.</p>
<h2>Irreverent</h2>
<p>Design and copywriting should not be taken too seriously; Fun but not offensive or cheesy.</p>
