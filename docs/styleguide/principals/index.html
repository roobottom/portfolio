  <h1>Design Principals</h1>
  <h2>A pleasurable reading experience</h2>
<p>Communication <em>via</em> the written word is one of life’s great pleasures. It’s essential that the reading experience on this site is delightful. Good typography is crucial and careful attention should be paid to the smallest detail.</p>
<h2>Be bold but concise</h2>
<p>In copy, use plain English and always put the most reverent details first. Use confident visual elements, bold typography and bright colours.</p>
<h2>Tactile</h2>
<p>This site should <em>feel</em> pleasing to navigate. Interactions should be as satisfying as interacting with real-world objects. Objects should flow from one state to another.</p>
<h2>Irreverent</h2>
<p>Design and copywriting should not be taken too seriously; Fun but not offensive or cheesy.</p>
