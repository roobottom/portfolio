  <h1>Clear, concise, <em>design</em> leadership</h1>
<h2>Design thinking. Developer know-how.</h2>
<p>Businesses the world over are reawakening to the power of design. They’re building products that are genuinely impactful and helping their customers succeed in ways they never thought possible. <em>Design</em> is the critical ingredient. It’s the special sauce that’s allowing them to supercharge everything they do.</p>
<p>I help organisations succeed through design by enabling teams to work smarter. With a background in design <em>and</em> development means I bring the best of both worlds into my work and in the way I manage designers.</p>
<p>Currently, I’m the Head of Design for <a href="https://fireflylearning.com">Firefly Learning</a> where I lead a team of incredibly talented UX, visual and communication designers.</p>
