  <h1>Clear, concise, <em>design</em> leadership</h1>
<h2>Design thinking; developer know-how</h2>
<p>Businesses the world over are reawakening to the power of in-house design teams. They’re building products that are genuinely impactful, helping their customers succeed in ways they never thought possible. <em>Design</em> is the critical ingredient. It’s the special sauce that’s allowing them to supercharge everything they do.</p>
<p>I help organisations succeed through design by enabling teams to work smarter. With a background in design <em>and</em> development I offer the best of both worlds in my work and leadership style.</p>
<p>Currently, I’m the Head of Design for <a href="https://fireflylearning.com">Firefly Learning</a> where I lead a team of incredibly talented UX, visual and communication designers. If you’d like to know more about how I’ve helped Firefly Learning succeed, read the case studies in the <a href="/work">work section</a>.</p>

          <p>Over the last five years, Firefly Learning has enjoyed tremendous success; we have grown from fifty schools to over five hundred. We now have offices in London, Sydney and Singapore. Our dream to transform learning by empowering all students, teachers and parents is a lot closer today than it was when I joined in September 2011.</p>

          <p>In 2016, our visual design process at Firefly Learning was a bit of a mess.  I lead a long-term initiative to overhaul our process and tooling which lead to significant gains in our velocity and quality of output.</p>

          <p>I don’t think its hyperbole to say that there’s a revolution happening in the design of digital products.  Designers have long had the idea of designing interfaces from a kit of pre-built parts, but never really had the tools to do this effectively. Sketch is such a tool.</p>
