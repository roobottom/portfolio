    <h2>European Adventure Week Three</h2>
    <p>Our final week, a last hurrah, and a dash across Switzerland, Germany, Belgium and France.</p>
<p>It was the briefest of interludes into Switzerland, still, in this country at least we managed to abide by the law and buy a Vignette at the border.</p>
<p>Our destination was a campsite not far from the northern lake town of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locarno">Lacarno</a>. After the damp squib that was our final day in Italy, the well-appointed campsite <a href="http://www.lidomappo.ch">Lido Mappo</a> was most welcome. And, what luck! A break in the weather which allowed Katie and I to get our tent up and once again double our living space. That evening we paid a brief (but expensive) visit to the campsite bar, then cooked-up a pasta-storm back at chez-Roobottom.</p>
<p>We awoke on Tuesday to beautiful sunshine. Using a combination of extremely poor Italian and much better English (on the part of the campsite staff) we’d established the the thing to do 'round these parts was to take the air with a brisk walk into Lacarno.</p>
<p>Being near the border Lacarno has brilliant mixture of Italian Joie de vivre and Swiss preciseness, that for us <em>slightly</em> obsessive compulsive types, is infinitely appearing. We ate pizza in the square before hiking up the many almost vertical side-streets to explore.</p>
<p>(figure set:lacarno-square)</p>
<p>I think the most abiding memory of this place is the view over the lake. I don’t really think there’s anything to separate this place from Lake Garda, it’s just different, but equally beautiful. I managed to get some pictures that <em>almost</em> capture some small part of it’s beauty. I imagine it’s hard to communicate the feeling you associate with a place through pictures or words alone. It’s probably why those that do are few and far between. I’m certainly not counting myself there, if you were wondering.</p>
<p>(figure set:lake-magorie)</p>
<p>In the afternoon we took the camper up the mountain to the Verzasca Dam where apparently, if you’re so inclined, you can do a <a href="http://www.trekking.ch/en/bungy/007-bungy-jumping-verzasca-like-james-bond">220m bungee jump</a> just like James Bond in Goldeneye. As we weren’t feeling <em>that</em> adventurous we made do with scaring ourselves by gawping over the fence at the dizzying drop. Why, after seeing that, you’d want to tie a piece of elastic around your legs and jump off I really couldn’t guess.</p>
<p>(figure set:verzasca)</p>
<p>On Wednesday we moved on to Germany, excited for our next adventure, but with the glimpse of the heavy heart that always accompanies a return to reality after a spectacular holiday. And spectacular this holiday has certainly been. It seems surreal at this point we’ve already driven nearly 2,000 miles. Pat on the head, van, for not letting us down — Thank goodness we didn’t buy a VW.</p>
<p>It’s a sign of how far north we now were that we saw the first British numberplate for almost two weeks. Then another, and another. By the time we arrived at <a href="http://www.trendcamping.de">Trend Camping</a> we were surrounded by the buggers.</p>
<p>(figure set:trendcamping)</p>
<p>The campsite had a rather nice bar which severed traditional German fare and local ales. So, despite the mud, it got the thumbs up from us. Especially when we discovered the huge power-showers, with massaging side-jets and everything. Luxury.</p>
<p>On Thursday we used the free bus and train pass that the campsite provided to visit the nearby <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfach">Wolfach</a>, a jolly little place that was once the hub of log-rafting and home to the pom-pom hat.</p>
<p>The center of the town is lovely, with cobbled streets and shops full of delicious looking things. It’s surrounded by glorious grassy hills and meadows, the kind you might imagine yourself running through into the arms of a Bavarian maiden. If you were so inclined.</p>
<p>(gallery set:wolfach)</p>
<p>And then it was Friday. Only two days left of our holiday. How did that happen? Oh well, we thought, nothing for it but to spend some time in Belgium.</p>
<p>What an amazing find for our last night. <a href="http://www.iledefaigneul.com">Camping Ile de Faigneul</a> is a site on it’s own island in the middle of a river. We’d have loved to spend more time in this tranquil place, but alas this was just an overnight stop on our way to Calais, the tunnel and home.</p>
<p>(figure set:faigneul)</p>
<p>We spent that last night as we did some many others, eating pasta, playing cards and watching Mad Men.</p>
<p>So it was with heavy hearts that we made our way thorough France to the Eurotunnel. We just had time to shop in the insanely large supermarket complex in Calais before boarding our train back to normality.</p>
<p>(figure set:calis)</p>
<p>That was it then. The end of a fantastic adventure that was entirely too short. It got dark at some point while were under the sea. Emerging onto cold, damp British soil we felt ready for a bed that wasn’t <em>slightly</em> too short. Home then. We’ll see you next time Europe, next time.</p>

    <h2>European Adventure Week Two</h2>
    <p>Our journey continued this week as we ventured across the Alps into Italy.</p>
<p>I’m sitting in the shade of a tree, providing some protection from the blazing mid-afternoon sun. Headphones in, I’m listening to Fink’s “Sort of Revolution” extremely loud and enjoying an ice-cold beer. I lean my head back, and close my eyes against the sun as it dapples through the leaves above me. In the distance are the mountains that circle Lake Garda. Sparse clouds are suspended, seemingly motionless over the azure blue waters. Fuelled by the warmth of the sun, the melodic beat of the music and the haze from the alcohol I feel an almost zen-like sense of well-being. “This is perfect” I thought.</p>
<p>In contrast to week one, when we’d travelled through five countries, we decided to slow the pace a little. After an epic drive our first stop was the Northern lake town of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nago–Torbole">Torbole</a>, the windsurfers paradise, and <a href="http://www.campingalporto.it/camp/">Camping Al Porto</a>. It felt Newquay-esq where board-shorts seemed to be the must-have fashion item of the season. The campsite was rather busier than those we’d been used to, but we managed to fit our van and awning on a shaded pitch thirty-seconds walk from the lake.</p>
<p>(figure set:torbole)</p>
<p>On the occasion of our first night in Italy, we did what we have the last two trips here: Find the most touristy looking restaurant and order the biggest pizza they have and a glass of the local beer. In this case it was <a href="http://www.forst.it/eng">Forst</a>, brewed “just up the road” we were told.</p>
<p>The next day we had ideas of taking windsurfing lesson but the wind didn’t seem to want to blow. It was probably too hot, so like us it decided to spend the day sunbathing and exploring the town. We also finally got the BBQ to work despite the crappy “just light the bag” charcoal, thanks to some German firelighters that almost took my face off.</p>
<p>It was at this point we cheated a little by spending a few nights in a hotel south of the lake in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desenzano_del_Garda">Desenzano del Garda</a>. “You know” said Katie “I’m loving being able to get out of the shower and being able to keep my feet dry.” I knew what she meant. I’m not proud to admit it but we really did wallow in the luxurious of it all.</p>
<p>(gallery set:hotel)</p>
<p>Peeling ourselves away from the hotel pool we ventured down the road to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirmione">Sirmione</a>. Navigating the spit of land that forms a sort of natural pier into the centre of the southern bank of the lake — we parked and ventured over the bridge into down-town Sirmione. Here we indulged our inner tourist once again by eating gelato and watching the sunset.</p>
<p>(figure set:sirmione)</p>
<p>Having made a large dent in our holiday funds we checked out of the hotel and moved north around the lake to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazise">Lazise</a>. Here we encountered the full glory of the Italian campsite. When you’re a good few kilometres from the centre on the main road you start to notice the signs. At first a just few, then more with increasing ferocity until they line the bank of the lake one after the other. You’re not, as we discovered, just expected to pick one and check-in. We spent an interesting couple of hours driving from site to site inspecting toilet blocks, pools, children’s entertainment and on-site bars before we finally gave in and just picked one.</p>
<p>(figure set:lazisesite)</p>
<p>Here we stayed and for four glorious days enjoyed the private beach and exploring the beautiful town. We swam, snorkelled and sunbathed. Ate gelato, pizza and even brought a fridge-magnet. No messing about, this was a proper holiday.</p>
<p>Alas, it was time to move on. Switzerland and our final week beaconed. We have a week left and just over two-thousand kilometres back to the Euro-tunnel at Calais.</p>
<p>To be continued…</p>

    <h2>European Adventure Week One</h2>
    <p>Being of noble birth Katie and I are taking in the sights of Europe on a three week grand tour.</p>
<p>However, having a chequebook that is of more moderate means we decided to conduct our trip in our campervan.</p>
<p>As I write this, we are driving from Salzburg to Lake Garda through the Alps. The scenery is breathtaking and a road sign tells me it’s  27 degrees, perfect driving weather, if our air con still worked.</p>
<p>(figure set:alps)</p>
<p>At this point we’ve covered 1,703 km and aside from a little smoke up some of the steeper sections of motorway our van is performing well. From our home in the south of England we took the tunnel from Dover to Calais, then to an overnight stop in northern France at <a href="http://www.campingmontdesbruyeres.com/english/">Saint-Amanda-les-eaux</a>.</p>
<p>(figure set:france)</p>
<p>To be honest, it wasn’t the most spectacular campsite, but it was clean and spent a very pleasant evening drinking beer and watching some men playing boules, one of whom looked suspiciously like Paul Whitehouse.</p>
<p>Feeling bolstered by our success driving on the other side of the road, we decided to head for Baden-Baden and <a href="http://www.campingplatz-adam.de/">Camplingplatz Adam</a> the next day; a distance of just over 600km. Actually, the drive turned out to be pretty straight-forward aside from one incident when we somehow missed the road closed signs and found ourselves driving over freshly prepared gravel, workmen shaking their heads in disbelief as we passed.</p>
<p>(figure set:adam)</p>
<p>We stayed in the beautiful campgrounds for three days, swimming in the lake and generally not doing much of anything. On the second day we managed to peel ourselves away and drove into Baden-Baden, where we partook of some very European things like eating outside and strolling along the promenade. Our Britishness didn’t like that very much and forced us onto the Dotto train so we’d feel more like tourists again. Phew.</p>
<p>(figure set:baden)</p>
<p>Sad as we were to leave, Salzburg beckoned, so we packed up the van and set off. This was another sweaty drive along Euro-route 52. Six hours later we were lost in the city. In situations like this Katie stays calm and I tend to overreact (a little). Ahem. Anyway, luckily on this occasion Katie was behind the wheel and did a sterling job of navigating the 5pm traffic until we <em>finally</em> reached <a href="http://www.panorama-camping.at/cms/index.php?lang=en">Panorama Camping</a>.</p>
<p>Wow, what a site! Brilliant views and with WC and show blocks that wouldn’t have been out of place in a five-star hotel. It’s also here that I first discovered the local brew, Stiegl.</p>
<p>The next day (despite <em>really</em> enjoying the beer) we made an early start into Salzburg. I’d once been here on a school trip but the only thing I remember with any clarity was the McDonalds. Katie kept insisting that the hills were alive with the sound of music, but I wasn’t sure what she meant by this.</p>
<p>Arriving by bus into Mozartsteg we made our way through the square, past the stalls selling Bavarian hats and up the hill to the fortress Hohensalzburg. After exploring for a bit we sat, pretzel and beer in hand, admiring the stunning view over the mountains.</p>
<p>(figure set:salzburg)</p>
<p>Next, I discovered a little more about those musical hills with a Sound of Music themed bus tour of the city. I secretly really enjoyed this ride around the sights of the city made (even more) famous by the film. We ended our day with a plate of Snitzel at the Stiegl brewery restaurant with (yup, you guessed it) a refreshing cold beer.</p>
<p>(figure set:pavilion)</p>
<p>Next is Lake Garda, it’s already hotter than Austria, so onto Italy!</p>
<p>To be continued…</p>

    <h2>Sigur Ros at the Eden Project</h2>
    <p>Katie and I are just back from a weekend in Cornwall with a few mates where we surfed, drank some <a href="http://www.tributeale.co.uk/">great beer</a> and enjoyed the amazing Sigur Ros live at the Eden Project.</p>
<p>Sigur Ros were one of those bands that had somehow passed me by so when our friend Tim suggested that we book tickets to see them I went more for the promise of surf than interest in the music.</p>
<p>(figure set:sigur_2)</p>
<p>We’d been to the <a href="http://www.edenproject.com/">Eden Project</a> a few years before and I was really exited to go back. It’s a brilliant place, especially the rainforest biome which had really grown since our previous visit.</p>
<p>As a venue it really succeeds. It’s a beautiful setting and the unique atmosphere really adds to the music. It’s also really well run with helpful stewards a token system for drinks that means there’s never a queue at the bar. Someone really know what they’re doing.</p>
<p>We arrived late, just in time to grab a beer and some food and catch the start of <a href="http://www.ohdaughter.com/">Daughter</a> who were great. They’re really melodic and boy she can sing, well worth a watch if you get the chance.</p>
<p>Eden is built at the bottom of an old quarry; the walls of which now team with plant life. By the time Sigur Ros took to the stage it was dusk and strings of fairly lights twinkled in the tress.</p>
<p>On stage, smoke filled the space as the band and their 11-piece orchestra started their set. The full-width monitor displayed a bizarre array of images as we were treated to what I can only describe as a wall-of-sound the band had built in front of the stage.</p>
<p>(figure set:sigur_1)</p>
<p>It was perfect. The venue and the atmosphere just worked so well. The light show too was spectacular. Lasers and smoke galore. I don’t mean to gush, but it really was one of the best gigs I’d ever been too. I was absolutely blown away by the band, his voice, the weird instruments and that sound. Oh, that brilliant sound.</p>
