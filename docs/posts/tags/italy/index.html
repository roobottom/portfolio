    <h2>Tuscany with a toddler</h2>
    <p>As a surprise for my mum’s 70th, my dad invited us on a pre Easter break to a house he’d rented in San Lorenzo a Vaccoli, a sleepy village a few kilometres outside of Lucca, in Italy’s Tuscany region.</p>
<p>The ratio of 4 adults to one toddler certainly made things a little easier with <em>Roo</em>. She had a brilliant time! Here’s some of the things we liked:</p>
<h2>Flying</h2>
<p>In contrast to the last time we flew with <em>Roo</em>, this time we’d deliberately not booked flights which demanded us be at the airport at some ungodly hour. This meant that she wasn’t tired and therefore in a good mood.</p>
<p>We were also a lot more prepared this time, we didn’t forget to bring her headphones or iPad pre-loaded with Peppa Pig.</p>
<p>The weather on the way out made for an especially memorable flight over the Alps. I really love this picture of <em>Roo</em>, captivated by the view:</p>
<p>(figure set:alps)</p>
<h2>Our house</h2>
<p>Our little home from home wasn’t so little! Being early in the season meant we picked up a bargain, and we’re able to stay in a massive country villa with amazing views. <em>Roo</em> especially loved the large fenced gardens, meaning she could tear around outside in relative safety. Being independent is increasingly important to her at the moment, so this was great.</p>
<p>(figure set:house)</p>
<h2>Pisa</h2>
<p>Although she quite enjoyed having her picture taken holding up the leaning tower, Pisa isn’t the most relaxing place to visit with a small child. We spent a few hours here, but any more would’ve pushed <em>Roo</em> over the edge and into the canyon of tantrum.</p>
<p>(figure set:leaningtower)</p>
<p>One thing we <em>did</em> really like here was the Botanical Gardens. These we’re uncrowded and gave <em>Roo</em> ample room to run around amongst the beautiful flowers. If you find yourself in Pisa with a small child, seek them out. For only €4 an adult, they’re the perfect antidote to the crowds in the Square of Miracles.</p>
<p>(figure set:gardens)</p>
<h2>Lucca</h2>
<p>Lucca is a fabulous place. We spent a couple of different days here, the first time just for a few hours to grab lunch and explore until the inevitable tiredness-time-bomb went off and a screaming child forced us home for tea.</p>
<p>The second time, while my mum and dad went off to Florence, Katie, <em>Roo</em> and I spent a whole day here. We hired a side-by-side bicycle, which she <em>loved</em>, shouting “ciao” at passers-by.</p>
<p>(figure set:bike)</p>
<p>We had more pizza outside at a <a href="http://www.ristorantesancolombanolucca.it/en/">lovely restaurant</a> where the staff we’re amazing with <em>Roo</em>, bringing her food out extremely quickly. This is mission critical, as I’m sure anyone with a hungry toddler in a public place will know.</p>
<p>(figure set:lunch)</p>
<p>After lunch, with <em>Roo</em> asleep in the push-chair, we explored the tiny winding streets. It was idilic in the afternoon sun. Katie went off to shop, and I took the opportunity to climb the recently restored <em>Torre Delle Ore</em>. The effort of climbing the 470 steps was rewarded at the top with an amazing view of the whole city and surrounding hills.</p>
<p>(figure set:tower)</p>
<p><em>Roo</em> woke up on the way back to the car, just as we were passing the merry go round. “I go on that?” she said. How could we refuse?</p>
<p>(figure set:merrygoround)</p>
<p>I’d highly recommend Lucca as an easy city to visit with a toddler. It had none of the crowds of Pisa, and felt an altogether more chilled out place.</p>
<h2>In summary</h2>
<p>We really hit the jackpot with both the location and weather for our week in northern Tuscany. There’s lot to enjoy for little people in this region if you’re prepared to miss out on some of the more famous places, and go where the crowds aren’t. We certainly had a brilliant time!</p>

    <h2>European Adventure Week Two</h2>
    <p>Our journey continued this week as we ventured across the Alps into Italy.</p>
<p>I’m sitting in the shade of a tree, providing some protection from the blazing mid-afternoon sun. Headphones in, I’m listening to Fink’s “Sort of Revolution” extremely loud and enjoying an ice-cold beer. I lean my head back, and close my eyes against the sun as it dapples through the leaves above me. In the distance are the mountains that circle Lake Garda. Sparse clouds are suspended, seemingly motionless over the azure blue waters. Fuelled by the warmth of the sun, the melodic beat of the music and the haze from the alcohol I feel an almost zen-like sense of well-being. “This is perfect” I thought.</p>
<p>In contrast to week one, when we’d travelled through five countries, we decided to slow the pace a little. After an epic drive our first stop was the Northern lake town of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nago–Torbole">Torbole</a>, the windsurfers paradise, and <a href="http://www.campingalporto.it/camp/">Camping Al Porto</a>. It felt Newquay-esq where board-shorts seemed to be the must-have fashion item of the season. The campsite was rather busier than those we’d been used to, but we managed to fit our van and awning on a shaded pitch thirty-seconds walk from the lake.</p>
<p>(figure set:torbole)</p>
<p>On the occasion of our first night in Italy, we did what we have the last two trips here: Find the most touristy looking restaurant and order the biggest pizza they have and a glass of the local beer. In this case it was <a href="http://www.forst.it/eng">Forst</a>, brewed “just up the road” we were told.</p>
<p>The next day we had ideas of taking windsurfing lesson but the wind didn’t seem to want to blow. It was probably too hot, so like us it decided to spend the day sunbathing and exploring the town. We also finally got the BBQ to work despite the crappy “just light the bag” charcoal, thanks to some German firelighters that almost took my face off.</p>
<p>It was at this point we cheated a little by spending a few nights in a hotel south of the lake in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desenzano_del_Garda">Desenzano del Garda</a>. “You know” said Katie “I’m loving being able to get out of the shower and being able to keep my feet dry.” I knew what she meant. I’m not proud to admit it but we really did wallow in the luxurious of it all.</p>
<p>(gallery set:hotel)</p>
<p>Peeling ourselves away from the hotel pool we ventured down the road to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirmione">Sirmione</a>. Navigating the spit of land that forms a sort of natural pier into the centre of the southern bank of the lake — we parked and ventured over the bridge into down-town Sirmione. Here we indulged our inner tourist once again by eating gelato and watching the sunset.</p>
<p>(figure set:sirmione)</p>
<p>Having made a large dent in our holiday funds we checked out of the hotel and moved north around the lake to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazise">Lazise</a>. Here we encountered the full glory of the Italian campsite. When you’re a good few kilometres from the centre on the main road you start to notice the signs. At first a just few, then more with increasing ferocity until they line the bank of the lake one after the other. You’re not, as we discovered, just expected to pick one and check-in. We spent an interesting couple of hours driving from site to site inspecting toilet blocks, pools, children’s entertainment and on-site bars before we finally gave in and just picked one.</p>
<p>(figure set:lazisesite)</p>
<p>Here we stayed and for four glorious days enjoyed the private beach and exploring the beautiful town. We swam, snorkelled and sunbathed. Ate gelato, pizza and even brought a fridge-magnet. No messing about, this was a proper holiday.</p>
<p>Alas, it was time to move on. Switzerland and our final week beaconed. We have a week left and just over two-thousand kilometres back to the Euro-tunnel at Calais.</p>
<p>To be continued…</p>

    <h2>Lake Garda, Italy</h2>
    <p>The weather was warm, the food was amazing and the wine was cheep. After 7 nights in Italy drifting around Lake Garda, being awed (and a little romantic) in Verona and getting (very) lost in Venice the reality of being back to work has hit like a tonne of bricks.</p>
<p>(figure set:lake)</p>
<p>But I prefer to think of the amazing time we had. As we landed at the tiny Besica airport we realised that the turbulence we had just endured was in fact heavy rain that drenched us as we ran from the plane to the cover of the arrivals lounge. From there we found ourselves sitting in the hire car, rain pounding on the windscreen, trying to get used to the uneasy feeling of sitting in the passenger side with a steering wheel in front of me. By the time we reached <a href="http://www.mistralhotels.it/admiral.htm">our hotel</a> we’d driven on three motorways and had a tiny disagreement with a barrier.</p>
<p>Thankfully the wing-mirror was unharmed and the rain had stopped to reveal blue sky. Things got even better when we got into our room - it was clean, big and had a balcony from which you could see the lake (sort of) through the trees. We spent the week exploring Lake Garda’s small towns and excellent restaurants, and venturing out to Verona and eventually Venice after planning to go on Wednesday and finally getting there on Friday - Due to a couple of days missing the train. Whoops!</p>
<p>(figure set:lake2)</p>
<p>My favourite place by far was Sirmione which was at the end of an tiny outcrop of land that juts into the south end of the lake. We spent an evening at the naturally heated <a href="http://www.termedisirmione.it/tds/en/homepage.html">spa</a> followed by dinner at <a href="http://www.ristorantearcimboldo.com/">L’Archimboldo</a> run by a really friendly guy who’s English was better than ours. If you’re going to Lake Garda Sirmione is a must.</p>
<p>(figure set:gondola)</p>
<p>Venice was amazing. Stepping out of the station, you’re immediately greeted with throngs of people walking up and down the banks of the Grand Canal. Wow! We took a water taxi up to St. Marks Square and stopped for lunch and some shelter from the hot-hot sun before we ventured into St Mark’s Basilica and mooched around the Square, avoiding the millions of pigeons that randomly landed on anyone they fancied, whether they had food or not.</p>
<p>We then set off around the labyrinth-like city on foot, exploring the seemingly unending passageways and tiny bridges. Needless to say we got horribly lost, and only just made our train back to the hotel. But I loved Venice, a day was just not enough. In usual style, I took nearly 700 photos - and you can <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/roobottom/sets/72157602449502521/">see some of them over at flickr</a>.</p>
<p>Oh well, back to reality I suppose.</p>
