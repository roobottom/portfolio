    <h2>Jekyll archives without plugins</h2>
    <p>I recently made the switch to <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> as my publishing tool for this website. I love it, not least as it lets me serve content directly from Github. Updating the site is as simple as pushing into my repository. I have no servers to maintain and no extra monthly costs. For a low traffic site it seems, for now at least, like the perfect solution.</p>
<p>(figure set:artwork)</p>
<p>To me, one of the most interesting things about writing a blog is the ability to look back, to make old posts new again with an easily navigable archive section. A key part of that is the ‘archives for year …’ page. However, hosting with Github pages means that I can’t use plugins for Jekyll that you’d normally need to achieve this. Jekyll doesn’t really offer much in the way of core functionality for archives, but with a bit of hacking you can create an archive page for every year in a way that doesn’t suck.</p>
<p>We can use the power of <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/">Jekyll collections</a> to <em>somewhat</em> automatically generate an archive page for each year your site has posts. There’s three main parts to the setup:</p>
<ol>
<li>Configure a collection for archives.</li>
<li>Create a post for each year for which you want an archive page.</li>
<li>Create a layout for processing each archive post into <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr></li>
</ol>
<h2>Configure the archives collection</h2>
<p>First, we need to tell Jekyll about our new collection. In my site configuration file, (usually <code>_config.yml</code>) I added the following:</p>
<pre><code>collections:
  archives:
    output: true
    permalink: /archives/:path/
</code></pre>
<p>This tells Jekyll that we want a collection called <strong>archives</strong>, that we want it to output an <code>index.html</code> for each item in the collection, and we want it to do so under the <code>/archives</code> url.</p>
<h2>Create a post per year</h2>
<p>Our new archives collection will read any markdown files in a folder named <code>_archives</code>, so we’ll have to create a post for each year your site has posts in this folder. This is why I say that this method is only <em>somewhat</em> automatic, however we’ll only every have to worry about updating this once per year.</p>
<p>For example, if we want an archive page for 2015 at <code>archives/2015</code> we’d create the post <code>_archives/2015.md</code>. The only thing that’s really required here is YML front matter, here’s a simplified version of my <code>2015.md</code>:</p>
<pre><code>---
title: Archives for 2015
year: &quot;2015&quot;
layout: archive-year
---
</code></pre>
<p>Don’t forget the quotation marks, the reason for them will shortly become apparent.</p>
<h2>Archive page layout</h2>
<p>Now we need to define a layout that Jekyll will use to output each archive page. I did this in a layout  <code>_layouts/archive-year.html</code>. Here’s a simplified version of my file:</p>
<pre><code>---
layout: default
---
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

{% for post in site.posts %}
    {% capture post_year %}{{ post.date | date: '%Y' }}{% endcapture %}
    {% if post_year == page.year %}
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;{{ site.baseurl }}{{ post.url }}&quot;&gt;{{ post.title }}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;       
    {% endif %}
{% endfor %}

&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Its all pretty simple really. We’re looping though all the posts on the site, and only displaying them if they match the target year. By the way, those quotation marks from earlier are required for matching the <code>post_year</code> with <code>page.year</code>, which both have to be strings</p>
<p>And that’s it. A <em>sort-of</em> automatic way to generate an archive page-per-year.</p>

    <h2>A New Website</h2>
    <p>Back in 2001, while I was still in midst of a degree that didn’t really teach me anything, I built the first version of roobottom.com on a crappy second-hand PC.</p>
<p>Originally a “Flash playground” (oh, weren’t <em>those</em> the days) I  redesigned and repurposed it into a blog around 2005. I’d also started freelancing, launching <strong>roodesign</strong> around the same time.</p>
<p>That was twelve years ago when I was slightly shorter in the tooth and smaller of belly and working for myself, eventually making the move down south, starting full-time in London. All this rather took up my time and thoughts of a personal web project went the same way as oh-so-many pies.</p>
<p>But a man can dream, and dream I did: first of a CSS3 wonderland with garish colours and effects galore. Then, deciding that blogs were entirely too much hassle, of a stark Neverland consisting purely of some witty paragraph of text and a few links to social networks I hated.</p>
<p>Eventually I went back to basics and fleshed out exactly what I wanted: Somewhere to write the occasional blog post, showcase my work and post my photographs.</p>
<h2>Firm foundations</h2>
<p>I built my first website because it was fun. I then got a job making websites, again because it was enjoyable. I’m lucky that I get paid for what is essentially a hobby. I think that makes me a “professional” but the jury is still out on that one.</p>
<p>So <em>this</em> site should be the most fun of all, right? I decided to abandon any highfalutin design ideas and just stick to a few core principals that would allow me to grow this site organically.</p>
<p>First was the logo. I’d been sketching some ideas around a typographic “roo” for a while. A kangaroo was also an obvious choice. The final result is the emblem you see at the top of this page. Not perfect by any means, but a good starting point. I’ll no doubt change it as the site grows.</p>
<p>(figure set:logo)</p>
<p>Secondly to start with core elements then work out from there. Creating a pleasant and easy-to-use website is key to this idea, but it’s more than that. By letting the content do the work and keeping the design as subtle as possible I’m striving for (but probably rarely achieving) a browsing experience that feels effortless.</p>
<p>I’ve chosen <a href="http://getkirby.com">Kirby</a> as my <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr>, this has so far proven to be the perfect fit, allowing me to write content in the fantastic <a href="http://www.iawriter.com">iA Writer</a> using <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown">Markdown</a> so I always start with uncluttered, unformatted text.</p>
<p>And finally, stop procrastination and just launch the bloody thing! I’ve spent entirely too many late nights debugging css to wait any longer. It’s a personal project that’ll grow. So here it is, warts and all.</p>
