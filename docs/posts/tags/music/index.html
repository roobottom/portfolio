    <h2>SOHN live at the Electric in Brixton</h2>
    <p>We’d been hankering to see <strong>SOHN</strong> for a while, ever since I’d played his first album, <em>Tremors</em>, almost to death last summer. So when his second album, <em>Rennen</em>, was released earlier this year it meant an album tour was sure to follow.</p>
<p>So last week Katie and I braved a journey on Southern Rail up to the old Fridge Club (now The Electric) in Brixton: A club <em>slightly</em> too small to accommodate a sold-out <strong>SOHN</strong> crowed. Katie and I tucked ourselves in neatly at the back.</p>
<p>(figure set:SOHN)</p>
<p>The smoke machines belched with great gusto as <strong>SOHN</strong> took the stage. Seated behind a huge synth, he immediately launched into <em>Tremmors</em>, his powerful, pitch-perfect voice silencing even the most persistent talker.</p>
<p>He seemed to delight in giving each song some kind of embellishment: Whether that be an extended middle-eight or noodling around at the end, it was there in every song. It was mesmerising. I love live music, mainly for the sense of shared-experience. Everyone was swept along on the wave of <strong>SOHN</strong>’s synths, it put me in mind of a shared religious experience, everyone in enraptured ensemble.</p>
<p>I was also massively impressed by the beautiful set design: An arrangement of parallel strip-lights that changed colour and pulsed on and off in step with the music. They were the perfect focal point as <strong>SOHN</strong> plied his wares on stage.</p>

<p>Since a small person came to live in our house, our opportunity for evenings out has been severely limited. It’s a rare thing when the stars align to allow us to have a night away from home without <em>Roo</em>, so we have to get it right when we do. We defiantly got it right with <strong>SOHN</strong>. 10/10.</p>

    <h2>Sigur Ros at the Eden Project</h2>
    <p>Katie and I are just back from a weekend in Cornwall with a few mates where we surfed, drank some <a href="http://www.tributeale.co.uk/">great beer</a> and enjoyed the amazing Sigur Ros live at the Eden Project.</p>
<p>Sigur Ros were one of those bands that had somehow passed me by so when our friend Tim suggested that we book tickets to see them I went more for the promise of surf than interest in the music.</p>
<p>(figure set:sigur_2)</p>
<p>We’d been to the <a href="http://www.edenproject.com/">Eden Project</a> a few years before and I was really exited to go back. It’s a brilliant place, especially the rainforest biome which had really grown since our previous visit.</p>
<p>As a venue it really succeeds. It’s a beautiful setting and the unique atmosphere really adds to the music. It’s also really well run with helpful stewards a token system for drinks that means there’s never a queue at the bar. Someone really know what they’re doing.</p>
<p>We arrived late, just in time to grab a beer and some food and catch the start of <a href="http://www.ohdaughter.com/">Daughter</a> who were great. They’re really melodic and boy she can sing, well worth a watch if you get the chance.</p>
<p>Eden is built at the bottom of an old quarry; the walls of which now team with plant life. By the time Sigur Ros took to the stage it was dusk and strings of fairly lights twinkled in the tress.</p>
<p>On stage, smoke filled the space as the band and their 11-piece orchestra started their set. The full-width monitor displayed a bizarre array of images as we were treated to what I can only describe as a wall-of-sound the band had built in front of the stage.</p>
<p>(figure set:sigur_1)</p>
<p>It was perfect. The venue and the atmosphere just worked so well. The light show too was spectacular. Lasers and smoke galore. I don’t mean to gush, but it really was one of the best gigs I’d ever been too. I was absolutely blown away by the band, his voice, the weird instruments and that sound. Oh, that brilliant sound.</p>
