    <h2>I made some Christmas cards</h2>
    <p>(figure set:cards,class:pull-both)</p>
<p>I tried my hand at watercolour and created some Christmas cards. I haven’t made any for years, but I’m making a concerted effort to draw every day, and this seemed like a productive use of my time.</p>

I don’t really have to be any good if I enjoy it.</p>
<p>(gallery set:rabbits)</p>
<p>Last time I visited my parents house I searched high and low for my old portfolio. No such luck, that thing is long gone. This time I’m determined to keep my drawings, maybe my kids would one day like to see the stupid drawing of rabbits their old man used to do in the more heady days of his 'youth’…</p>
