    <h2>Some thoughts on design leadership</h2>
    <p>I spent some of last week listening to some great design leaders share their thoughts at <a href="https://2017.leadingdesignconf.com/">Leading Design 2017</a>. Hosted by the fine folks from <a href="https://clearleft.com/">Clearleft</a> the event is now in its second year.</p>
<p>Before last year’s event, I was still trying to figure out what my job was, let alone how to do it well. I think my biggest fear when I took the position was that I would no longer have much to offer. Increasingly I’d be taking on less and less of the day-to-day work, and without producing designs or churning out HTML what was I? Last year’s conference helped me to figure out at least some of what I should be doing with my days:</p>
<ul>
<li>Designing team processes, environments and culture</li>
<li>Protecting the team from too much work</li>
<li>Evangelising design’s role in the company’s success</li>
</ul>
<p>My <a href="http://roobottom.com/articles/56/">notes from last year</a> are a bit of a mess. This tells me that I hadn’t really fully understood what any of these new responsibilities were. In fact, its taken the last year for me to get a handle on what any of these mean for my working life. Was I doing a shitty job in the meantime? No, well, I certainly don’t think so. I just hadn’t fully appreciated that I’d taken the step out of a production role and into a leadership role and that I was completely unprepared for what that meant.</p>
<p>The more I learn about design leadership, the more I realise that in most of the challenges you face every day, you can usually ditch the word <em>design</em>. Leadership is its own thing, a skill you have to be taught and then refine over time. Just because you can design doesn’t automatically mean you can lead a team of designers. Not something I was quick to pick up on. My advice for new design leaders is to realise that you’re unprepared for this new challenge and to cut yourself some slack when things inevitably go wrong.</p>
<hr>
<p>This year, I kept a page at the front of my notebook titled “Overall thoughts” and whenever I heard common themes that struck a chord, I wrote them down:</p>
<ul>
<li>Things go wrong for everyone, no team is perfect, not even those with 100s of designs and huge budgets</li>
<li>No-one in your company knows what design leadership is. Spend more time with other design leaders</li>
<li>Be the “shit umbrella” — protect your team</li>
<li>Managing designers is hard (although, I’d change this to managing people is hard)</li>
<li>Strategic partnership is a must. Strive to understand how you can help others in your company solve problems by understanding their point of view</li>
<li>Take the time to understand your business, not just the role of design within it</li>
<li>Ask obvious questions, it’s a safe bet that your not the only one who doesn’t understand</li>
</ul>
<p>My thoughts on design leadership continue to evolve. I don’t think I’ll ever get to a point where I can write a comprehensive list of what makes a good Head of Design. Like anything, you get better at it over time. There’s always more to be learned, and always some way to be better at your job.</p>
<p>I do think it’s important to keep evaluating and striving to be better. And, of course, events like Leading Design give you time to step back from the coalface and formulate your thoughts.</p>

    <h2>Common threads from Leading Design Conference 2016</h2>
    <p>I’ve just spent three days at the Barbican enjoying the inaugural Leading Design Conference. Having being promoted the role of Head of Design fairly recently, I found the vast majority of the talks and both workshops extremely poignant.</p>
<p>This was also the sense I got from my fellow attendees. Chatting with people over lunch, or a beer later on, I was struck by just how many “Yeah, me too!” moments we had. It turns out that leading design is hard, but I’m reassured to know that people have the same problems as me.</p>
<p>I was further reassured at the common themes that emerged over the event. It means we’re all on similar pages (or, at least we’re all reading the same book), and in an attempt to sift through those bits of knowledge that really spoke to me, here’s my top (sometimes badly paraphrased) common threads from the last three days. This is far-from all the messages that spoke to me, but this is the stuff that will have most immediate impact on my work:</p>
<h2>Designing design</h2>
<p><a href="http://scottberkun.com/">Scott Berkun</a>’s talk <em>Design vs. The World</em> started the conference on the right note with a big picture view of what it means to do design in the real world, and how it isn’t just pushing pixels around a screen. It got me thinking about my role, and how its increasingly solving problems that aren’t related to UI design, or writing CSS.</p>
<p>Later, during the Q&amp;A session with <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/aboutthebbc/insidethebbc/managementstructure/biographies/whitney_julia/">Julia Whitney</a> (BBC), <a href="http://www.dannyhearn.me/">Danny Hearn</a> and <a href="https://www.markboulton.co.uk/">Mark Boulton</a> (Monotype), it was said (with perhaps a hint of lamentation) that we’re no longer doing design at the coal-face, rather it’s our job to design the design experience: The environments and culture in which our teams works, and the processes they lean-on to get their work done.</p>
<p>This really struck a chord with me.</p>
<h2>Resistance is futile</h2>
<p>Someone (I’m sorry I can’t remember who) included a slide of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borg_(Star_Trek)">Locutus of Borg</a>, simultaneously making the point about assimilating into other team’s cultures, and scoring points with me for a Star Trek reference.</p>
<p>In her talk <em>New on the Job: Your First 90 Days in a Design Leadership Role</em> <a href="http://pnts.us/">Andrea Mignolo</a> talked about the “layer cake”, a delicious way to visualise the hierarchy in your company. She argued that you had to design the experience for each layer, to talk about design in the language of your audience.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/@ccourage">Catherine Courage</a> said “Strive for shared empathy”, the points in the middle where you can meet and talk design in a way thats understandable by even the most numbers-driven business development manager.</p>
<p>In both her talk and brilliant workshop <a href="http://www.practicallyux.com/">Gail Swanson</a> taught us about presenting to decision makers. We used mapping techniques to better understand the drivers for those people from whom we seek approval. This is definitely a technique I’ll try at Firefly, to be able to frame an argument in a way that already fits in with the pressures and  priorities of others is incredibly powerful.</p>
<h2>Dark matter</h2>
<p>How do we quantify the value of design? Its difficult to ask quantitative questions when you’re dealing with solving problems on an emotional level. How would you measure a target like “Users feel 9% more engaged this quarter”? We don’t have the tools to measure qualitative data like this. And yet, this is the stuff that really adds value.</p>
<p><a href="http://nathan.com/">Nathan Shedroff</a>’s talk <em>Using the Waveline: Mapping Premium Value to the User Journey (a new tool for planning deeper customer experiences)</em> detailed how to start to measure the emotional impact over time that your product or service has, and how this can be designed for maximum empathy.</p>
<p>If you’re at all involved in designing anything for anyone (I would argue that’s everyone), then I’d recommend further reading into Nathan’s Waveline theories. It’s certainly something I’ll investigate further.</p>
<h2>A quick note on the conference itself</h2>
<p>Leading Design was perhaps the most useful, insightful and timely conference I’ve ever attended. Huge thanks to <a href="http://clearleft.com/is/andy-budd">Andy Budd</a> et al for doing such a great job, and spotting the need for this event. You asked if we wanted another in 2017, its a resounding “yes” from me.</p>
<p>The last thing I want to mention was the venue. I jumped a the chance for a tour of the Barbican during the lunch break the second day. If you’re a fan of brutalist architecture then this site is must-see. It was the perfect venue for a fantastic three days of conference.</p>

    <h2>Firefly Learning Conference 2015</h2>
    <p>Aside from <a href="http://www.bettshow.com/">The Bett Show</a>, the Firefly Learning Conference is our biggest UK event of the year. It’s a chance for our clients to get together and listen to some fantastic speakers from all areas of Education.</p>
<p>Part of the draw, <em>we hope</em>, is to see what’s coming next in Firefly. <a href="https://twitter.com/j0ejack">Joe</a> does his “Steve Jobs” and wows the crowd with the top-secret features we’ve been working on in the preceding months. This year was particularly crowd pleasing as we announced the next major version of our software: Firefly 6.</p>
<p>While a full review of the day itself is no-doubt forthcoming on the <a href="http://fireflylearning.com/blog">Firefly Blog</a>, for me, the conference is chance to reflect on the previous 12 months and celebrate the achievements of my team, and all of the brilliant people I get to work with every day. There are, however, some highlights that particularly stuck out from the day, that I wanted to mention first.</p>
<h2>David Gifford, Graphic Facilitator</h2>
<p><a href="http://inscriptdesign.com">David Gifford</a>, aka Josh, is a good friend of Firefly and an all-round top bloke. He’s also an incredible artist. He brought his formidable talents to bear on the day providing sketch notes of all the sessions. Aided by Firefly’s own Rachel Anderson, they captured the essence of all the talks in cartoon form. This proved hugely popular, and was one of my highlights of the day.</p>

<h2>Team time</h2>
<p>It’s not often all the Fireflies gather in one place, so when we do there’s always a particular buzz in the air. The conference is pretty unique as it’s an exciting event anyway, add in a smattering of friend’s you’ve not seen for a while and you’ve got yourself a pretty fantastic day. We’re a bunch of people who genuinely love what we do, and I think that shows. I’m sure our clients would agree!</p>

<h2>Designing Firefly 6</h2>
<p>During 2014 we cemented our move from part-agency to a full product company. We’ve really built on that move this year; With an expanded product team and a huge push to make user experience a core part of how we build software. My team, Design, have been instrumental in the development of Firefly 6. We now sit as part of the product team, and along side Development and UX we’ve undertaken the design of four new iOS apps and the design and front-end build of Firefly on the web.</p>
<p>Over the last few months we’ve updated almost all our processes, right from the way we’ve massively increased the amount of research we do with teachers, students and parents; to creating a pattern library for all our front-end code.</p>
<p>I’ve <a href="/articles/46/">said it before</a>, but it bares repeating: I’m incredibly proud of all we’ve achieved this year, and can’t wait to get Firefly 6 into the hands of our teachers and their students.</p>

    <h2>Firefly Conference 2014</h2>
    <p>Over the last couple of months Firefly’s design team have been even busier than usual. The reason for this flurry of activity was three new themes we’d be working for the big launch at the Firefly Learning Conference.</p>
<p>There’s a <a href="http://fireflylearning.com/blog/firefly-learning-conference-round-up">full writeup</a> on the Firefly blog, but I wanted to share a little about the process of creating the new themes that we hope will give students, teachers and parents an improved experience while using Firefly.</p>
<p>Since the launch of Firefly 5 last year, we’ve learnt a lot from our clients about what worked for them and what didn’t.  We’ve also worked with some fantastic schools, creating bespoke themes, which gave us a wealth of ideas of the features students and teachers really want.</p>
<p>Using this feedback, we were able to distill a clear list of the <em>type</em> of themes schools wanted, along with the customisation options that would appeal. We determined to build three new themes: One a playful, friendly theme; Another, clean and succinct; Lastly, a super minimalist theme.</p>
<p>When I joined, just over three years ago, Firefly were five people crammed into a small office hidden away in a dark corner of One Lyric Square. The design department consisted of me and a pack of half empty Sharpies. Today we’re a forty strong team, with three (soon to be four) designers, with our own office in sunny Brighton. Over the summer holidays we were joined by intern <a href="http://www.adammmarsh.com">Adam Marsh</a> and, with his help, we set about designing the new themes.</p>
<p>(figure set:team)</p>
<p>I’m really proud of the hard work the entire team put in creating the new themes. This is just the start, we’re planning a number of upgrades to these themes as well as several new themes in the coming months.</p>
<p>You can see all the Firefly themes at <a href="http://themes.fireflylearning.com">themes.fireflylearning.com</a>.</p>
