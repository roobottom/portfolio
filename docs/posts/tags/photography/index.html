    <h2>Lightpainting with Mary</h2>
    <p>How I persuaded Mary to stand in the freezing cold while I flung sparks at her is still a mystery. Nonetheless, after the sun went down this evening we ventured to Swanbourne Lake in Arundel.</p>
<p>(figure set:mary1,class:pull-both)</p>
<p>I’d scouted this location a couple of weeks ago. That evening I’d managed to fire off a few shots in the old boat-house before being chased away by an angry swan. This time we ventured further around the lake and found a spot where several low trees grow out into the lake, their spider-leg branches submerged here and there.</p>
<p>The goal for tonight was that staple of light-painting; &quot;Sheltering from Sparks&quot;. The key to this photo is having a long enough shutter speed to capture the sparks and paint in your subject, but not so long that any movement picked up. Mary was excellent at holding still, but holding an umbrella and yourself perfectly still for ten seconds is almost impossible. In the end we found that an exposure of 5-6 seconds was the longest Mary could manage without moving at all.</p>
<p>There are probably other ways that this photo could be done, but as there was only two of us, I had to start off the timer, light the wire-wool and spin the sparks. So, rather than painting Mary in separately, I set up two  flashlights just far enough away to gently build-up the light over the course of the exposure.</p>

<p>I’m pretty pleased with the results of this evening’s outing, and now that I know I have a willing model I might be calling on her services again for some other photo ideas I have. Lucky her…</p>

    <h2>Project 365 2015</h2>
    <p>When I tried, and failed to write of review of 2014 I was a little disgusted at my poor memory. What <em>did</em> we do in January 2014? Honestly I have no idea, and aside from the obvious <em>recovered from the Christmas hangover</em> or <em>decided to loose some weight</em> January is a blur.</p>
<p>All these moments in our lives go by so quickly. I suppose this is one of the reasons that services like Facebook are so popular — they allow you to capture moments in your life and then give you a way to play it back at a later date. It’s exactly for this reason I started writing things down and publishing them here.</p>
<p>What better way to document 2015, the year we’re expecting our first child, than to take a photo every day. I have <a href="/gallery/365-2010">tried this before</a>, but gave up at day 16. I’m hopeful this time will be different and, inspired by <a href="http://mockingbirdcomic.com/comic-365/">Flix’s Project 365</a> rules, I’ve set myself some guidelines.</p>
<ul>
<li>Take at least one photo every day.</li>
<li>If you miss a day, don’t worry about it. Carry on the next day.</li>
<li>Write something about the photo. A paragraph or two will do.</li>
<li>Replacing photos is fine, as long as it’s just a better shot of what was there before.</li>
</ul>
<p>(figure set:jan)</p>
<p>My ultimate aim is to have a collection of memories from the year. Some will be mundane, most will be badly lit, but there may be a few we’ll print out and put on our walls. Treasured memories from what’s hopefully going to be a fun, scary and pooey nappy filled year.</p>
