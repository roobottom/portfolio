    <h2>A brand new Roo</h2>
    <p>I’m excited and emotional. What’s got me into such a tizzy you ask? Well, a few weeks ago Katie and I discovered we we’re going to have a baby. A brand new Roo, if you will.</p>
<p>(figure set:the_kid)</p>
<p>How did this little chap (or chapesses) come about? That my friends is a mystery, but suffice to say that Katie tells me that getting a small person to live inside you is quite an involved process requiring me to provide lots of chocolate because &quot;Baby needs chocolate&quot;.</p>
<p>Whoever you are, if you’re reading this — perhaps years later at the behest of a therapist — know this; I love you. I’m not sure how, why or if it’s madness to love a smudge on the screen of a hospital scanner, but I do. Just the thought of you is enough to reduce me to tears of joy. Goodness knows what I’ll be like when you’re actually born.</p>
<p>One of the brilliant things about living in Britain is the NHS. They ensure that all of your bits and bobs are growing in the right places via the technological marvel of ultrasound. We were able to see you, and hear your heart beat, which is apparently a very health 157 bpm.</p>
<p>Parents were suitably delighted, siblings overjoyed and friends a chorus of coos and congratulations. Those friends with children exchange knowing glances and delight in regaling us with their tails of woe.</p>
<p>“Remember that night” said one friend to his wife, &quot;when you were changing him in the middle of the night and I woke up to see a stream of hot lava squirt across the room and onto the wall?&quot;. She laughs. He laughs. We all laugh, oh <em>how</em> we laugh.</p>
<p>So it’s with a mixture of excitement and fear that I share this wondrous news. If you’re wondering what to buy me for Christmas then can I suggest a plastic apron and a gas-mask?</p>

    <h2>She said Yes!</h2>
    <p>It’s been a while coming, but finally I popped the question and for some unknown reason Katie said yes!</p>
<p>(figure set:ring)</p>
<p>So this is it then, I’m off the market. Please ladies, don’t weep and don’t, for goodness sake, do anything silly. On a serious note, I’d like to say a big BIG thank you to all that have congratulated us over the last couple of weeks. I’m really looking forward to my life with Cake - she’s a good 'un… I’m not a big fan of deeply personal emotions on my blog - but screw it, I bloody love her. I couldn’t be happier.</p>

    <h2>200 Miles Due South</h2>
    <p>As close friends will know I made a big move in August, one that saw me packing up my life in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walsall">Walsall</a> and moving 200 miles to the South-coast.</p>
<p>(figure set:beach)</p>
<p>The last two-and-a-bit months in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Littlehampton">Littlehampton</a> have been fun to be sure, but <em>very</em> different to my life in Walsall. I just want to say a BIG thanks to all the people who’ve made me feel so welcome, and an equally big thanks to friends in Walsall for being so supportive of me moving away.</p>
<p>It’s great to have joined a <a href="http://www.aruncommunitychurch.com/">new church</a>, where I’ve been made to feel very at home, but sad to have left behind such a <a href="http://www.walsallcommunitychurch.org/">great community</a>.</p>
