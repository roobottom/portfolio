    <h2>A love letter to a tiny island</h2>
    <p>“Archipelago” is such a lovely word. It conjures images of far-flung island chains, sunkissed beaches and ragged shorelines. Twenty-eight miles off the southwestern tip of England is Cornwall’s own archipelago: The Isles of Scilly.</p>
<p>The islands are a place of contrast. Beautiful yet wild. Bright white beaches nestle alongside sea ravaged cliffs. Windswept hills sit beside sheltered coves and inlets.</p>
<p>My wife Katie and I have visited many times: With friends; As girlfriend and boyfriend; As husband and wife; And more recently, with our small family.</p>
<p>This is my love letter to the Islands: A collection of memories from all those trips to Scilly. Out of order and somewhat idealised. The way good memories should be.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The crossing</h2>
<p><em>In 2012, Katie and I were due to fly via helicopter, alas it was grounded due to technical difficulty. We had to stay overnight in Penzance and catch the ferry the following day…</em></p>
<p>Every morning, throughout the summer a passenger ferry departs from the quay in Penzance. Aboard you’ll find serval hundred seats, two cafés and thousands of small white bags in dispensers attached to the bulkheads.</p>
<p>This is the <em><abbr title="Royal Mail Vessel">RMV</abbr> Scillonian III</em>, and she’s been transporting excited — and occasionally green — tourists from the mainland to the Isles of Scilly since 1977.</p>
<p>(figure set:scillonian,class:pull-both)</p>
<p>There are more comfortable ways to get to the Scillies: A small seven-seater plane dubbed <em>Skybus</em> that flies from Lands End, Newquay or Exeter. And, in times past, there was a helicopter that flew from Penzance that was always our favourite way to get to the islands. Alas, this ceased operation at the end of 2012. We were booked on a mid-morning flight, but due to there being a large hole in the side of the helicopter, we were forced to overnight in a nearby hotel to catch the ferry the following day.</p>
<p>On this particular voyage, we secured our regular spot on the middle deck, near the back door. This is the ideal spot for Katie to sit as motionless as possible and endure any rough crossing.</p>
<p>Knowing the best thing to do is leave her alone, this position also avails me of an escape route outside to the upper deck. From here, it’s not unusual to spot gigantic shoals of fish or even dolphins in the wake of the engines. In rough water, this is also the optimal location to enjoy the power of the seas. And to keep a weathered eye on the horizon, just in case.</p>
<p>At capacity, the Scillonian carries 485 souls some of whom line the upper deck like birds on a telephone wire. It’s a busy place to be, people perched atop benches, leaning on the rigging, or hanging over the rails.</p>
<p>Whatever may come, we’re all now locked together for the two-hours and forty-five-minute trip. Knowing looks are passed over the heads of the unsuspecting day trippers by those of us who’ve travelled this way before. “Poor sods” our brief eye contact seems to say, as we don our pressure point travel bands and pop an array of chemical remedies for <em>mal de mare</em>.</p>
<p>Luckily, all this preparation is for nought. Once we rounded Gwennap Head off Lands End, and are in full steam towards the islands, most of the more unpleasant effects of the sea are behind us. On a sunny day, there’s no better way to arrive on Scilly than by boat.</p>
<p>What’s astonishing is the speed at which the passengers disappear once we’ve docked in St Mary’s harbour. Some hang around on the quay waiting for smaller tender boats to the off-islands. Most make the happy walk up the dock, past the Mermaid pub and along Hugh Street, draining off down the various alleyways and lanes to their holiday accommodations.</p>
<p>At any one time throughout the summer there are thousands of visitors on the islands. And yet, it doesn’t ever feel busy. Scilly is full of secret places, quiet beaches and deserted coves.</p>
<p>Our journey took us via the <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g488312-d1168609-Reviews-Kavorna_Cafe_Bistro-St_Mary_s_Isles_of_Scilly_England.html">Kavorna Café</a> (to pick up our first Cornish pasty of the holiday), over Garrison Lane and onto Littleporth to where our friend’s mum has a place that looks out over Porthcressa beach.</p>
<p>(figure set:view,class:pull-both)</p>
<p>Naturally, the door is unlocked. Unloading our bags in the doorway, we made our way through the house and out into the garden. Finally, we sank into various bits of unmatched garden furniture and savoured our pasties in silence, taking in the gorgeous view, ready for our holiday to start.</p>

<h2>A lovely day for boating</h2>
<p><em>In 2017, my wife Katie, daughter “Roo” and I visited Scilly along with our friends Cath and Dave…</em></p>
<p>“Mummy! I want to get up now!”</p>
<p>I turned over and looked at my watch. 8:05. Wow, she slept well.</p>
<p>“Daddy!”</p>
<p>OK, kid, give me a minute here. But Katie’s already out of bed and padding down the creaky corridor.</p>
<p>“Shh, you’ll wake Cath and Dave”, I hear Katie tell <em>Roo</em>. Rolling over I caught a glimpse of the sun streaming in at the window. Time to get up.</p>
<p>“Mummy, we on holy-day”,  <em>Roo</em> confidently tells Katie as they, by degrees, make their way down the corridor. Katie was taking significantly more care than <em>Roo</em>, who skipped down the hall like a demented rabbit.</p>
<p>I joined my family in the Kitchen. It really was a gorgeous day. A quick check of the BBC’s weather app informed me that it’s a balmy twenty-five degrees with light winds. A lovely day for boating.</p>
<p>After breakfast we executed our plan: Heading for St Martins. Five of us; intrepid seafarers standing on the quay, tickets in hand watching the <em>Sea King</em> draw alongside the waiting passengers.</p>
<p>(figure set:seaking,class:pull-both)</p>
<p>Landing at Higher Town, our first port of call was <a href="http://www.theislandbakery-stmartins.com/">The Island Bakery</a> for the day’s supplies. Fully stocked with Cornish pasties and cola cake, we trundled up the single track road and over the brow of the hill before taking the path cut through a field overgrown with Scilly’s ubiquitous Bracken. The vast swathe of white sand of Great Bay was almost deserted. Besides a few families lounging here and there we’re the only people, so finding a sheltered spot was simple.</p>
<p>(figure set:digging,class:pull-left)</p>
<p>Seaside days used to be a relaxed affair but with <em>Roo</em> in tow, it’s now more like mobilising a beach assault. Once the shelter was up, beach mats laid out and sun cream applied, we unpacked the various excavating tools. Thankfully she’s still a bit too small to want to bury daddy, so digging giant holes was the order of the day. <em>Roo</em> took up her position as site foreman then Dave, and I set about our task of digging several large holes and interconnecting trenches. Eventually, the tide will come up and fill this carefully engineered system, much to <em>Roo’s</em> delight, after which Dave and I will have to frantically shore-up walls and rebuild various dams.</p>
<p>All too soon the site whistle sounds for lunch.</p>
<p>“Lads! Lunchtime!”</p>
<p>Sated, crumb covered, and chocolate stained we emerged from lunch. If only <em>Roo</em> can have a nap in the beach shelter, maybe we can have a relaxing hour catching up on some reading. She doesn’t take much coaxing, exhausted from bossing us around she’s happy to sleep.</p>
<p>One or two of us drifted off too. It’s hard not to in the warmth of the day and with the rhythmic whoosh of the sea lapping at the beach. On waking, I felt the need to burn off all that pasty. It’s was time to break out the wetsuit and snorkel and explore the crystal clear waters.</p>
<p>Wetsuit, booties, flippers, mask and flippers. All the gear and no idea. Penguin-like, I gingerly waddled my way down to the shoreline and into the freezing waters of the Atlantic. Once waist-deep, I took a big breath and rolled forward into the water. Waiting for the cold water effect to pass, I wrangled the mask into position over my face and entered the underwater world.</p>
<p>Below the water barrier, I’m in another world entirely. From the beach, I must look like Manatee in distress, but down in my aquatic environment, I felt like Jacques Cousteau about to discover some previously unimagined species.</p>
<p>Further out the water was clear all the way to the bottom some five meters below, where Kelp forests sheltered shoals of fish. A sudden shot of panic as my lizard brain picked up movement in my peripheral vision: A large striped fish darted out of the Kelp. I followed at a distance. He came to rest in a clearing, and I was able to float above him and just watch for what seemed like an eternity.</p>
<p>(figure set:snorkel,class:pull-both)</p>
<p>“I saw a <em>massive</em> fish out there”, I announced to Katie, extending my arms to demonstrate its size, adding a few centimetres in the tradition of men everywhere when talking about the size of things.</p>
<p>“That’s nice dear”, she replied. “But we need to pack up and go, or we’ll miss the last boat back.”</p>
<p>Everyone was contemplative on the return to St Mary’s. Even <em>Roo</em> — who was up on her knees so she could see over the side — was uncharacteristically quiet. It was hard not to get lost in that view; the ocean glinting like a blanket of tiny diamonds, the twin islands of St. Agnes and Gugh slung low on the horizon.</p>
<p><em>Roo</em> was asleep as soon as her head hit the pillow. Perfect, especially as Dave and Cath had kindly offered to babysit.</p>
<p>A great tradition on our visits to Scilly — perhaps <em>the</em> tradition — is partaking in a scone or two at <a href="http://www.julietsgardenrestaurant.co.uk/">Juliet’s Garden</a>. Perched on top of a hill, the garden offers spectacular views over Tresco. On a warm day, there’s nothing quite like sitting in Juliet’s Garden cramming copious amounts of scone and tea into ones face.</p>
<p>(figure set:juliets,class:span-both)</p>
<p>Juliet isn’t just famed for her cream teas, she also runs a fantastic restaurant. On arrival this evening, Katie and I were served drinks in the garden while watching the gorgeous sunset. Then, taking our seats inside, we were treated to an incredible three-course meal.</p>
<p>As the evening was warm, and our bellies were full we decided to forego a taxi and walk. We sat a while on the flat rock above Town Beach and watched the boat lights bobbing around in the harbour. I don’t think either of us wanted the evening to end. Eventually, though, the lure of bed called us, and we reluctantly slunk back to the house. I often think of that romantic evening on the flat rock as one of my stand out memories of our trip that year. For me, a balmy evening watching small boats on the water <em>is</em> quintessentially Scilly.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The Scilly Cart, Co.</h2>
<p><em>In 2014, on our last holiday, before Roo was born, we visited Scilly with our friends Cath, Dave and Emily.</em></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.scillycart.co/">Scilly Cart Co </a> used to have a Facebook page on which it posted pictures, usually taken by disgruntled locals, of the imperfect parking decisions taken by tourists when hiring a cart for the day. When you arrive at the Cart Co’s depot, you’re greeted with a display board of these photos followed by a pep-talk by the owner on the evils of annoying the locals with where you choose to park.</p>
<p>(figure set:cart,class:pull-left)</p>
<p>With these words of warning rising in our ears Dave and I pulled out onto the main road, each of us determined to follow the rules to the letter. How we ended up attempting to break the land-speed record is anyone’s guess. One moment we were driving along sensibly, the next we were bouncing up and down in our seats trying to squeeze every ounce of speed we could from our formula-z cart. Needless to say, we weren’t very successful, and no traffic laws were violated.</p>
<p>After the girls were aboard, we set out along the Telegraph Road that circles the innards of the island. There was no plan beyond maybe finding a beach and most definitely finding somewhere for lunch. I’ve gotta admit that — despite appearances — driving a golf-buggy is crazy fun. So we kept driving, twice around the island in fact, before we eventually decided we needed some lunch.</p>
<p>This was the birth of another great tradition: Lunch at <a href="http://www.scillycountryhouse.com/about-us/kaffeehaus/">Kaffeehaus Salbei</a>, a German-inspired café and guesthouse. When it’s hot, and not too busy, you can get a table outside or else swelter inside the conservatory. The German Platter is a must, with homemade bread and Bavarian meats and cheeses. Then, of course, one must have either the Apfelstrudel or — my personal favourite — a slice of Sacher Torte. I swear the cart was noticeably slower after lunch. It was either the weight of the food, or the battery had taken a beating from our multiple laps of the island.</p>
<p>Locals on the islands often supplement their income by making things, which are offered for sale by the side of the road. An honesty box is provided for you to remunerate the artist for their handiwork. There is such a place on Porth Loo Lane. With time on our hands, we parked the cart and went for a look.</p>
<p>(figure set:fox,class:pull-right)</p>
<p>This particular treasure-trove was in the craftsperson’s garden shed. Inside, we found all manner of items. Some cobbled together from flotsam and jetsam. Some reclaimed from household bits and bobs. One thing, in particular, caught Dave’s eye: A fox, made from an old piece of brown carpet. One mad button eye was sewn onto its face, another for its nose. It was beautiful. It was perfect. He had to have it. I think it is a source of great regret that he didn’t buy it there and then. We should have known really, but when we returned later it was already gone. I like to think of it in an ornamental frame, in pride of place above someone’s fireplace. Lucky buggers.</p>
<p>Later, the cart safely returned with minimal damage, we headed to the Atlantic for dinner and the pub quiz. We were all too drunk (or too stupid) to answer any of the questions well, and “team bum trumpets” inevitably place dead last.</p>
<p>On any other evening, a night-out on Scilly would end with the closing of the pub. But not tonight, tonight we were off to Barry’s.</p>
<p>Once a week, Barry opens the doors to his basement for the world famous Barry’s Disco. Imagine the scene: 50 sweaty people dancing the night away in a tiny basement to the hot disco “hits” of the late 90s. God knows what time we finally got out of there. Needless to say, we all had a little lay-in the next morning.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Gigs</h2>
<p><em>In 2009, without planning to, Katie and I visited St.Mary’s in the same week as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Pilot_Gig_Championships">World Gig Pilot Gig Championships</a>…</em></p>
<p>All week, St.Mary’s had been its usual, tranquil place: Little sailing boats had bobbed in the harbour; Gentle winds had blown across the sun-kissed beaches. And the island’s pubs and eateries had no queues at the bar or required bookings for dinner.</p>
<p>That all changed on Friday morning when the Scillonian docked and brought ashore the first of the revellers who’d come to Scilly to enjoy the weekend’s racing. The Isles of Scilly Steamship Company runs the Scillonian twice-a-day on Gig weekends, dumping several thousand people on the islands in quick succession.</p>
<p>The whole character of the island was transformed. Pubs, who’d obtained exclusive licences for the occasion, remained open 24-hours a day for the duration. There was a not-so-small minority of people who were here for the weekend, but hadn’t anywhere to stay, electing instead to spend their entire time in the boozer.</p>
<p>This didn’t dent the enjoyment, far from it. Experiencing this new aspect of Scilly was exciting. Everyone was very jolly, and even a weekend fuelled by alcohol and little sleep didn’t seem to dampen their enthusiasm for cheering on their team.</p>
<p>If you’re not familiar, a Cornish Pilot Gig is a six-person boat about 10 meters long and 1.5 meters wide. In addition to the six rowers, a Cox steers and shouts encouragement and is responsible for ensuring the crew makes land before last orders.</p>
<p>Gigs are a common sight on the Scillies. Their names, like “Slippen”, “Bonnet” and “Nornour” pay homage to the memory of their namesakes who, in the 17th and 18th centuries, were used as transfer vessels to take Pilots out to larger ships. A Pilot was a local sailor who could navigate safely through the treacherous, rock-laden waters of the archipelago.</p>
<p>We got chatting with a man in a pub. A misty-eyed old sea dog. He told us that it was often the case that more than one Pilot was available at any one time, and the first man to arrive would get the job. So the Gig crews took to racing, the fastest sailors would get paid, and that’s how the Gig races on the Isles started. It’s a romantic story, and I’d like to believe it’s true.</p>
<p>The races start out at sea. The officials string a line buoys to form a start line out by Nut Rock. The crews then wait in their boats as close to the start line as they can. But woe betides any vessel that crosses the line before “go” is called. They get instantly disqualified.</p>
<p>There are old rivalries and alliances between teams who come from all over the world. These all go out of the window once the call comes to start. Every crew for themselves. A crew of six, pulling for all their worth. From the start line, they race across the clear stretch of water to St.Mary’s harbour.</p>
<p>From our vantage point up on the Garrison, it looks pandemonium; oars churning the sea into a raging torrent. All around the Gigs are the island’s small ferry boats filled to bursting with spectators who’ve paid for the privilege of a close-up view. Add to this the hundreds of smaller private crafts, and you wonder how they don’t smash into each other.</p>
<p>All around us, people are screaming at the top of their lungs, as if the object of their affection could actually hear them way out at sea. I wouldn’t be surprised if they could, such is the roar of the crowd.</p>
<p>The shouting reached fever pitch as the first of the boats rounded the quay, finish line in sight. Given how long they’ve been racing the gap between them was astonishingly close. I’m not sure how they tell, but the first Gig to cross the finish line immediately started to celebrate. They must have been knackered, but somehow they found the strength to row the final few meters to Town Beach. Here, there’s a whole army of people to help them drag the Gig up onto the beach.</p>
<p>(figure set:gigs,class:pull-both)</p>
<p>Wanting to drink-in more of the atmosphere and a couple of the local ales, Katie and I headed to the Mermaid. This place is incredibly claustrophobic at the best of times, with memorabilia covering every inch of every available surface. Saturday evenings are particularly busy, but this was something else. We could see punters spilling out onto the pavement as we approached. The only way to get in was to forcibly push through the sweaty throng. I imagine as we introduced ourselves into the crush, two other people were ejected from another door somewhere. This place was full.</p>
<p>Inside the beer was flowing. People were dancing on tables. Tall tales were being told of the day’s victories. Somehow we managed to get a seat, Katie on the end of a bench, and me perched awkwardly on a window ledge. What a night! We emerged several hours later, a little drunk and horse from trying to make ourselves heard.</p>
<p>This is one of my favourite memories of the Islands. I felt totally immersed in the culture. Caught-up in something. It was a unique experience that I don’t think we could ever recapture. In a way, I wouldn’t want to. It was perfect, trying to get it back would somehow sully it.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Taking flight</h2>
<p><em>In 2008, I took my first trip to the islands, and my first flight on a helicopter…</em></p>
<p>There’s always a sadness that accompanies leaving the Isles of Scilly. It started for me this first year and has never diminished on subsequent trips. At least you used to be able to offset this with the excitement of a trip on the helicopter.</p>
<p>After waving goodbye to our bags, which would be taken to the airport for us by Island Carriers, we headed into town. Now was the chance to buy as much <abbr title="Isles of Scilly">IOS</abbr> branded tat as we could lay our grubby hands on. Of course, there was the Isles of Scilly tea towel; The Isles of Scilly fridge magnet; The Isles of Scilly puffin jigsaw; And the Isles of Scilly pencil and pencil sharpener deluxe set. Our friends and family were, understandably, delighted!</p>
<p>Maxing-out your baggage allowance on a helicopter is surprisingly straightforward. We discovered this at check-in when both of our cases — now laden with souvenirs — were well over the 15 kg limit. Luckily the airport staff were as laid-back as every other islander we’d met, and waved us through.</p>
<p>St.Mary’s Airport is by far the smallest terminal I’ve ever flown from. It’s miniature waiting area probably never any busier than it was now. A few people milled around, while others enjoyed hot drinks from styrofoam cups.</p>
<p>When the time came, we were called into a small side room with the other passengers for our flight. Here, we were shown a short safety film from the late 80s. Then we heard it. A helicopter coming into land. The great throb-throb-throb of its propeller blades displacing the air.</p>
<p>One of British International’s two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikorsky_S-61">Sikorsky S-61</a> helicopters landed with the slightest bounce. The side door flung open, and the passengers disembarked, ducking instinctively under the rotor blades.</p>
<p>(figure set:helicopter,class:pull-both)</p>
<p>Then it was our turn. Our air steward lead the way out onto the runway. We ducked under the rotors too, clinging desperately to lose items of clothing. Of course, we felt like rock stars.</p>
<p>Once belts were fastened, the door was shut behind us with a reassuringly heavy click. Not that you can hear much above the roar of the engine, which now wound up ready for take-off. We felt an increase in the side-to-side wobble, and suddenly we were moving. The helicopter’s nose tipped forward and we swept up and along the runway. It’s exhilarating! The raw power that’s required to push this massive metal tube into the air must be immense. You feel every last joule of it.</p>
<p>The view is spectacular. Passengers lucky enough to get window seats were furiously taking as many photos as they could. It’s too loud for conversation, so we just gesticulated to each other, pointing at things we recognised.</p>
<p>Flying at 150 <abbr title="Miles Per Hour">mph</abbr>, it only takes 20 minutes from St.Marys to Penzance. All too soon the islands disappeared over the horizon, and Lands End appeared in the port side windows. Moments later we were touching down at Penzance heliport.</p>
<p>And that was that. Suddenly we were back to reality. Cars and people everywhere. Waiting for our bags, Katie asked me what I thought. She’d been extolling the virtues of Scilly since we’d met. “I’m in love”, I said. Or something like that. That’s the problem with memories, isn’t it? It’s sometimes hard to tell them apart from dreams.</p>

    <h2>Tuscany with a toddler</h2>
    <p>As a surprise for my mum’s 70th, my dad invited us on a pre Easter break to a house he’d rented in San Lorenzo a Vaccoli, a sleepy village a few kilometres outside of Lucca, in Italy’s Tuscany region.</p>
<p>The ratio of 4 adults to one toddler certainly made things a little easier with <em>Roo</em>. She had a brilliant time! Here’s some of the things we liked:</p>
<h2>Flying</h2>
<p>In contrast to the last time we flew with <em>Roo</em>, this time we’d deliberately not booked flights which demanded us be at the airport at some ungodly hour. This meant that she wasn’t tired and therefore in a good mood.</p>
<p>We were also a lot more prepared this time, we didn’t forget to bring her headphones or iPad pre-loaded with Peppa Pig.</p>
<p>The weather on the way out made for an especially memorable flight over the Alps. I really love this picture of <em>Roo</em>, captivated by the view:</p>
<p>(figure set:alps)</p>
<h2>Our house</h2>
<p>Our little home from home wasn’t so little! Being early in the season meant we picked up a bargain, and we’re able to stay in a massive country villa with amazing views. <em>Roo</em> especially loved the large fenced gardens, meaning she could tear around outside in relative safety. Being independent is increasingly important to her at the moment, so this was great.</p>
<p>(figure set:house)</p>
<h2>Pisa</h2>
<p>Although she quite enjoyed having her picture taken holding up the leaning tower, Pisa isn’t the most relaxing place to visit with a small child. We spent a few hours here, but any more would’ve pushed <em>Roo</em> over the edge and into the canyon of tantrum.</p>
<p>(figure set:leaningtower)</p>
<p>One thing we <em>did</em> really like here was the Botanical Gardens. These we’re uncrowded and gave <em>Roo</em> ample room to run around amongst the beautiful flowers. If you find yourself in Pisa with a small child, seek them out. For only €4 an adult, they’re the perfect antidote to the crowds in the Square of Miracles.</p>
<p>(figure set:gardens)</p>
<h2>Lucca</h2>
<p>Lucca is a fabulous place. We spent a couple of different days here, the first time just for a few hours to grab lunch and explore until the inevitable tiredness-time-bomb went off and a screaming child forced us home for tea.</p>
<p>The second time, while my mum and dad went off to Florence, Katie, <em>Roo</em> and I spent a whole day here. We hired a side-by-side bicycle, which she <em>loved</em>, shouting “ciao” at passers-by.</p>
<p>(figure set:bike)</p>
<p>We had more pizza outside at a <a href="http://www.ristorantesancolombanolucca.it/en/">lovely restaurant</a> where the staff we’re amazing with <em>Roo</em>, bringing her food out extremely quickly. This is mission critical, as I’m sure anyone with a hungry toddler in a public place will know.</p>
<p>(figure set:lunch)</p>
<p>After lunch, with <em>Roo</em> asleep in the push-chair, we explored the tiny winding streets. It was idilic in the afternoon sun. Katie went off to shop, and I took the opportunity to climb the recently restored <em>Torre Delle Ore</em>. The effort of climbing the 470 steps was rewarded at the top with an amazing view of the whole city and surrounding hills.</p>
<p>(figure set:tower)</p>
<p><em>Roo</em> woke up on the way back to the car, just as we were passing the merry go round. “I go on that?” she said. How could we refuse?</p>
<p>(figure set:merrygoround)</p>
<p>I’d highly recommend Lucca as an easy city to visit with a toddler. It had none of the crowds of Pisa, and felt an altogether more chilled out place.</p>
<h2>In summary</h2>
<p>We really hit the jackpot with both the location and weather for our week in northern Tuscany. There’s lot to enjoy for little people in this region if you’re prepared to miss out on some of the more famous places, and go where the crowds aren’t. We certainly had a brilliant time!</p>

    <h2>First holiday with a toddler</h2>
    <p>We recently spent a week in Portugal where we rented a villa just outside Caldas da Rainha, a mid-sized town, an hour’s drive north of Lisbon.</p>
<p>For our first family holiday, we’d decided to play it safe and booked a somewhere child-friendly on <a href="https://www.holidaytots.co.uk/">Holiday Tots</a>. It was great! It had a gated pool, and all the toys the child could ever want. It was also close to beaches, restaurants and interesting places to visit.</p>
<p>The weather was a bit of a mixed bag, we had a few nice days, but if you like it hot (Like I do) then mid-October isn’t really the time to visit Portugal. It certainly wasn’t warm enough to heat the solar-powered pool heater. I went in a few times, but it was too cold for Katie and <em>Roo</em>.</p>
<h2>Striking a balance</h2>
<p>Every now and again I have a moment where it dawns on me that we have a child now, and our lives will never be the same again. Our first family holiday was one of those moments. Gone were the late night meals-out and morning lay-ins of holidays gone by. We could no longer plan days out that consisted purely of thing that Katie and I wanted to do. We had a little head to consider.</p>
<h2>Things we liked</h2>
<p>I think we managed to strike a balance, and found activities that we all enjoyed. <em>Roo</em> (for the most part) was happy to go with the flow, and enjoyed exploring new places.</p>
<p>Here’s some of the things we liked in and around Caldas da Rainha.</p>
<h3>Food</h3>
<p>The Portuguese all seemed to love children, so made eating out at lunch extremely easy. There were excellent restaurants almost  everywhere we went, but a personal favourite was the vegetarian restaurant <a href="http://maratona.tv/">Maratona</a> in the centre of Caldas. They were brilliant with <em>Roo</em>, rushing through an order of chips to prevent the inevitable mealtime meltdown.</p>
<p>(figure set:maratona)</p>
<h3>Exploring</h3>
<p>We were delighted to find that <em>Roo</em> didn’t mind mooching around villages and towns. She was fascinated by the shops full of (mainly tile-based) gifts. As long as she was fed and could enjoy the occasional ice cream she was happy.</p>
<p>The monastery at Albobaça was a particular favourite, with it’s large stone rooms. She loved hearing her footsteps and voice echoing down the corridors, <em>“echo, Mummy!”</em></p>
<p>(figure set:monastery,class:span-both)</p>
<p>We also really liked Óbidos, a fortified city that dates back to the 13th century. She loved the shops, castle and ice cream. We loved exploring the castle walls, the wonderful weather and the local cherry liqueur that you drink from a chocolate cup.</p>
<h3>Lisbon Oceanarium</h3>
<p>She <em>loved</em> the Oceanarium in Lisbon. We did have to queue a little for tickets (top tip: book online before you go) but the efficient staff meant our wait was fairly short.</p>
<p>I would love to know what she was thinking as she stared up at the double-floor height tank full, packed to the <em>gills</em> with all kind of fish. Its difficult to know what goes through that little head, but she chatted about <em>“fsh”</em> all the way back to the Villa.</p>
<p>(figure set:oceanarium)</p>
<h3>Buddha Eden</h3>
<p>The Buddha Eden in Bombarral is an amazing place. Set in 30 acres of beautiful gardens are hundreds of sculptures from all over Asia. <em>Roo</em> loved the wide open spaces and all the huge sculptures. There’s also some well times cafés where we were able to refuel while <em>Roo</em> had a sleep in her push-chair.</p>
<p>(figure set:buddha)</p>
<h3>Beaches, parks and gardens</h3>
<p>Besides all the things we paid money for, there were plenty of free things that we enjoyed too. There is a beautiful park in Caldas that was a big hit with <em>Roo</em>, full of amazing green spaces, a lovely play-park and a couple of nice cafés.</p>
<p>There’s also some really great beaches in this area, which were deserted when we visited, it being so late in the year. The sea was freezing, but that didn’t stop <em>Roo</em> enjoying a paddle.</p>
<p>(figure set:park)</p>
<h2>Things we didn’t like as much</h2>
<p>The flight home was a bit rubbish. We’d stayed in a hotel at the airport the night before, but hadn’t really thought through the night sharing a room with <em>Roo</em>. So, between a disturbed night in a strange room and the 4:30am start to get our early flight its fair to say that <em>Roo</em> wasn’t in the best of moods.</p>
<p>Halfway home, in order to placate our struggling child, Katie had taken her on a walk down the isle to visit the cabin crew. While there she decided to vomit over the side of the plane and several unsuspecting passengers. Tiredness had gotten the better of her.</p>
<h2>In summary</h2>
<p>We had a brilliant time in Portugal, we’d thoroughly recommend it as a holiday destination with a small child. It was different, for sure, but I think we made it work, and made some more happy memories with the <em>Roo</em>.</p>

    <h2>European Adventure Week Three</h2>
    <p>Our final week, a last hurrah, and a dash across Switzerland, Germany, Belgium and France.</p>
<p>It was the briefest of interludes into Switzerland, still, in this country at least we managed to abide by the law and buy a Vignette at the border.</p>
<p>Our destination was a campsite not far from the northern lake town of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locarno">Lacarno</a>. After the damp squib that was our final day in Italy, the well-appointed campsite <a href="http://www.lidomappo.ch">Lido Mappo</a> was most welcome. And, what luck! A break in the weather which allowed Katie and I to get our tent up and once again double our living space. That evening we paid a brief (but expensive) visit to the campsite bar, then cooked-up a pasta-storm back at chez-Roobottom.</p>
<p>We awoke on Tuesday to beautiful sunshine. Using a combination of extremely poor Italian and much better English (on the part of the campsite staff) we’d established the the thing to do 'round these parts was to take the air with a brisk walk into Lacarno.</p>
<p>Being near the border Lacarno has brilliant mixture of Italian Joie de vivre and Swiss preciseness, that for us <em>slightly</em> obsessive compulsive types, is infinitely appearing. We ate pizza in the square before hiking up the many almost vertical side-streets to explore.</p>
<p>(figure set:lacarno-square)</p>
<p>I think the most abiding memory of this place is the view over the lake. I don’t really think there’s anything to separate this place from Lake Garda, it’s just different, but equally beautiful. I managed to get some pictures that <em>almost</em> capture some small part of it’s beauty. I imagine it’s hard to communicate the feeling you associate with a place through pictures or words alone. It’s probably why those that do are few and far between. I’m certainly not counting myself there, if you were wondering.</p>
<p>(figure set:lake-magorie)</p>
<p>In the afternoon we took the camper up the mountain to the Verzasca Dam where apparently, if you’re so inclined, you can do a <a href="http://www.trekking.ch/en/bungy/007-bungy-jumping-verzasca-like-james-bond">220m bungee jump</a> just like James Bond in Goldeneye. As we weren’t feeling <em>that</em> adventurous we made do with scaring ourselves by gawping over the fence at the dizzying drop. Why, after seeing that, you’d want to tie a piece of elastic around your legs and jump off I really couldn’t guess.</p>
<p>(figure set:verzasca)</p>
<p>On Wednesday we moved on to Germany, excited for our next adventure, but with the glimpse of the heavy heart that always accompanies a return to reality after a spectacular holiday. And spectacular this holiday has certainly been. It seems surreal at this point we’ve already driven nearly 2,000 miles. Pat on the head, van, for not letting us down — Thank goodness we didn’t buy a VW.</p>
<p>It’s a sign of how far north we now were that we saw the first British numberplate for almost two weeks. Then another, and another. By the time we arrived at <a href="http://www.trendcamping.de">Trend Camping</a> we were surrounded by the buggers.</p>
<p>(figure set:trendcamping)</p>
<p>The campsite had a rather nice bar which severed traditional German fare and local ales. So, despite the mud, it got the thumbs up from us. Especially when we discovered the huge power-showers, with massaging side-jets and everything. Luxury.</p>
<p>On Thursday we used the free bus and train pass that the campsite provided to visit the nearby <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfach">Wolfach</a>, a jolly little place that was once the hub of log-rafting and home to the pom-pom hat.</p>
<p>The center of the town is lovely, with cobbled streets and shops full of delicious looking things. It’s surrounded by glorious grassy hills and meadows, the kind you might imagine yourself running through into the arms of a Bavarian maiden. If you were so inclined.</p>
<p>(gallery set:wolfach)</p>
<p>And then it was Friday. Only two days left of our holiday. How did that happen? Oh well, we thought, nothing for it but to spend some time in Belgium.</p>
<p>What an amazing find for our last night. <a href="http://www.iledefaigneul.com">Camping Ile de Faigneul</a> is a site on it’s own island in the middle of a river. We’d have loved to spend more time in this tranquil place, but alas this was just an overnight stop on our way to Calais, the tunnel and home.</p>
<p>(figure set:faigneul)</p>
<p>We spent that last night as we did some many others, eating pasta, playing cards and watching Mad Men.</p>
<p>So it was with heavy hearts that we made our way thorough France to the Eurotunnel. We just had time to shop in the insanely large supermarket complex in Calais before boarding our train back to normality.</p>
<p>(figure set:calis)</p>
<p>That was it then. The end of a fantastic adventure that was entirely too short. It got dark at some point while were under the sea. Emerging onto cold, damp British soil we felt ready for a bed that wasn’t <em>slightly</em> too short. Home then. We’ll see you next time Europe, next time.</p>

    <h2>European Adventure Week Two</h2>
    <p>Our journey continued this week as we ventured across the Alps into Italy.</p>
<p>I’m sitting in the shade of a tree, providing some protection from the blazing mid-afternoon sun. Headphones in, I’m listening to Fink’s “Sort of Revolution” extremely loud and enjoying an ice-cold beer. I lean my head back, and close my eyes against the sun as it dapples through the leaves above me. In the distance are the mountains that circle Lake Garda. Sparse clouds are suspended, seemingly motionless over the azure blue waters. Fuelled by the warmth of the sun, the melodic beat of the music and the haze from the alcohol I feel an almost zen-like sense of well-being. “This is perfect” I thought.</p>
<p>In contrast to week one, when we’d travelled through five countries, we decided to slow the pace a little. After an epic drive our first stop was the Northern lake town of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nago–Torbole">Torbole</a>, the windsurfers paradise, and <a href="http://www.campingalporto.it/camp/">Camping Al Porto</a>. It felt Newquay-esq where board-shorts seemed to be the must-have fashion item of the season. The campsite was rather busier than those we’d been used to, but we managed to fit our van and awning on a shaded pitch thirty-seconds walk from the lake.</p>
<p>(figure set:torbole)</p>
<p>On the occasion of our first night in Italy, we did what we have the last two trips here: Find the most touristy looking restaurant and order the biggest pizza they have and a glass of the local beer. In this case it was <a href="http://www.forst.it/eng">Forst</a>, brewed “just up the road” we were told.</p>
<p>The next day we had ideas of taking windsurfing lesson but the wind didn’t seem to want to blow. It was probably too hot, so like us it decided to spend the day sunbathing and exploring the town. We also finally got the BBQ to work despite the crappy “just light the bag” charcoal, thanks to some German firelighters that almost took my face off.</p>
<p>It was at this point we cheated a little by spending a few nights in a hotel south of the lake in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desenzano_del_Garda">Desenzano del Garda</a>. “You know” said Katie “I’m loving being able to get out of the shower and being able to keep my feet dry.” I knew what she meant. I’m not proud to admit it but we really did wallow in the luxurious of it all.</p>
<p>(gallery set:hotel)</p>
<p>Peeling ourselves away from the hotel pool we ventured down the road to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirmione">Sirmione</a>. Navigating the spit of land that forms a sort of natural pier into the centre of the southern bank of the lake — we parked and ventured over the bridge into down-town Sirmione. Here we indulged our inner tourist once again by eating gelato and watching the sunset.</p>
<p>(figure set:sirmione)</p>
<p>Having made a large dent in our holiday funds we checked out of the hotel and moved north around the lake to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazise">Lazise</a>. Here we encountered the full glory of the Italian campsite. When you’re a good few kilometres from the centre on the main road you start to notice the signs. At first a just few, then more with increasing ferocity until they line the bank of the lake one after the other. You’re not, as we discovered, just expected to pick one and check-in. We spent an interesting couple of hours driving from site to site inspecting toilet blocks, pools, children’s entertainment and on-site bars before we finally gave in and just picked one.</p>
<p>(figure set:lazisesite)</p>
<p>Here we stayed and for four glorious days enjoyed the private beach and exploring the beautiful town. We swam, snorkelled and sunbathed. Ate gelato, pizza and even brought a fridge-magnet. No messing about, this was a proper holiday.</p>
<p>Alas, it was time to move on. Switzerland and our final week beaconed. We have a week left and just over two-thousand kilometres back to the Euro-tunnel at Calais.</p>
<p>To be continued…</p>

    <h2>European Adventure Week One</h2>
    <p>Being of noble birth Katie and I are taking in the sights of Europe on a three week grand tour.</p>
<p>However, having a chequebook that is of more moderate means we decided to conduct our trip in our campervan.</p>
<p>As I write this, we are driving from Salzburg to Lake Garda through the Alps. The scenery is breathtaking and a road sign tells me it’s  27 degrees, perfect driving weather, if our air con still worked.</p>
<p>(figure set:alps)</p>
<p>At this point we’ve covered 1,703 km and aside from a little smoke up some of the steeper sections of motorway our van is performing well. From our home in the south of England we took the tunnel from Dover to Calais, then to an overnight stop in northern France at <a href="http://www.campingmontdesbruyeres.com/english/">Saint-Amanda-les-eaux</a>.</p>
<p>(figure set:france)</p>
<p>To be honest, it wasn’t the most spectacular campsite, but it was clean and spent a very pleasant evening drinking beer and watching some men playing boules, one of whom looked suspiciously like Paul Whitehouse.</p>
<p>Feeling bolstered by our success driving on the other side of the road, we decided to head for Baden-Baden and <a href="http://www.campingplatz-adam.de/">Camplingplatz Adam</a> the next day; a distance of just over 600km. Actually, the drive turned out to be pretty straight-forward aside from one incident when we somehow missed the road closed signs and found ourselves driving over freshly prepared gravel, workmen shaking their heads in disbelief as we passed.</p>
<p>(figure set:adam)</p>
<p>We stayed in the beautiful campgrounds for three days, swimming in the lake and generally not doing much of anything. On the second day we managed to peel ourselves away and drove into Baden-Baden, where we partook of some very European things like eating outside and strolling along the promenade. Our Britishness didn’t like that very much and forced us onto the Dotto train so we’d feel more like tourists again. Phew.</p>
<p>(figure set:baden)</p>
<p>Sad as we were to leave, Salzburg beckoned, so we packed up the van and set off. This was another sweaty drive along Euro-route 52. Six hours later we were lost in the city. In situations like this Katie stays calm and I tend to overreact (a little). Ahem. Anyway, luckily on this occasion Katie was behind the wheel and did a sterling job of navigating the 5pm traffic until we <em>finally</em> reached <a href="http://www.panorama-camping.at/cms/index.php?lang=en">Panorama Camping</a>.</p>
<p>Wow, what a site! Brilliant views and with WC and show blocks that wouldn’t have been out of place in a five-star hotel. It’s also here that I first discovered the local brew, Stiegl.</p>
<p>The next day (despite <em>really</em> enjoying the beer) we made an early start into Salzburg. I’d once been here on a school trip but the only thing I remember with any clarity was the McDonalds. Katie kept insisting that the hills were alive with the sound of music, but I wasn’t sure what she meant by this.</p>
<p>Arriving by bus into Mozartsteg we made our way through the square, past the stalls selling Bavarian hats and up the hill to the fortress Hohensalzburg. After exploring for a bit we sat, pretzel and beer in hand, admiring the stunning view over the mountains.</p>
<p>(figure set:salzburg)</p>
<p>Next, I discovered a little more about those musical hills with a Sound of Music themed bus tour of the city. I secretly really enjoyed this ride around the sights of the city made (even more) famous by the film. We ended our day with a plate of Snitzel at the Stiegl brewery restaurant with (yup, you guessed it) a refreshing cold beer.</p>
<p>(figure set:pavilion)</p>
<p>Next is Lake Garda, it’s already hotter than Austria, so onto Italy!</p>
<p>To be continued…</p>

    <h2>Lake Garda, Italy</h2>
    <p>The weather was warm, the food was amazing and the wine was cheep. After 7 nights in Italy drifting around Lake Garda, being awed (and a little romantic) in Verona and getting (very) lost in Venice the reality of being back to work has hit like a tonne of bricks.</p>
<p>(figure set:lake)</p>
<p>But I prefer to think of the amazing time we had. As we landed at the tiny Besica airport we realised that the turbulence we had just endured was in fact heavy rain that drenched us as we ran from the plane to the cover of the arrivals lounge. From there we found ourselves sitting in the hire car, rain pounding on the windscreen, trying to get used to the uneasy feeling of sitting in the passenger side with a steering wheel in front of me. By the time we reached <a href="http://www.mistralhotels.it/admiral.htm">our hotel</a> we’d driven on three motorways and had a tiny disagreement with a barrier.</p>
<p>Thankfully the wing-mirror was unharmed and the rain had stopped to reveal blue sky. Things got even better when we got into our room - it was clean, big and had a balcony from which you could see the lake (sort of) through the trees. We spent the week exploring Lake Garda’s small towns and excellent restaurants, and venturing out to Verona and eventually Venice after planning to go on Wednesday and finally getting there on Friday - Due to a couple of days missing the train. Whoops!</p>
<p>(figure set:lake2)</p>
<p>My favourite place by far was Sirmione which was at the end of an tiny outcrop of land that juts into the south end of the lake. We spent an evening at the naturally heated <a href="http://www.termedisirmione.it/tds/en/homepage.html">spa</a> followed by dinner at <a href="http://www.ristorantearcimboldo.com/">L’Archimboldo</a> run by a really friendly guy who’s English was better than ours. If you’re going to Lake Garda Sirmione is a must.</p>
<p>(figure set:gondola)</p>
<p>Venice was amazing. Stepping out of the station, you’re immediately greeted with throngs of people walking up and down the banks of the Grand Canal. Wow! We took a water taxi up to St. Marks Square and stopped for lunch and some shelter from the hot-hot sun before we ventured into St Mark’s Basilica and mooched around the Square, avoiding the millions of pigeons that randomly landed on anyone they fancied, whether they had food or not.</p>
<p>We then set off around the labyrinth-like city on foot, exploring the seemingly unending passageways and tiny bridges. Needless to say we got horribly lost, and only just made our train back to the hotel. But I loved Venice, a day was just not enough. In usual style, I took nearly 700 photos - and you can <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/roobottom/sets/72157602449502521/">see some of them over at flickr</a>.</p>
<p>Oh well, back to reality I suppose.</p>

    <h2>The Rain in Spain</h2>
    <p>(figure set:a)</p>
<p>Isn’t it funny how you meet new people? Let’s say for example that you commented on someones <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a> photos, and six months later you fly out to Spain to visit them. Well, funnily enough (cue sincere laughter) that’s exactly what happened to me.</p>
<p>Madrid was awesome, and a good time was had by all. We saw castles, bars, mountains, bars, shops, bars, trains, planes and automobiles. Oh, and bars. But all this got me thinking up until I’d actually spent more than one afternoon with Liz I’d been feeling a little… seedy about meeting someone over the internet. Maybe that’s not the right word, but my limited vocabulary doesn’t allow me to be any more descriptive.</p>
<p>I’m sure you know what I mean, ‘meeting’ people via the internet does have a certain stigma attached to it. I’m very happy to say in this case my new friend (who I’ve firmly move up from ‘flickr friend’ status) turned out to be awesome.</p>

    <h2>A camp weekend</h2>
    <p>There’s nothing quite like waking up at 4.30am on a very cold night, desperate for the loo, and then realising you’re in a tent on top of a foggy hill in the middle of Derbyshire.</p>
<p>It’d actually been a really nice sunny Good-Friday, perfect for mountain biking. So we set off: Four blokes, one van and Jayne (Chris’ sat-nav lady friend) - Gripped, sorted, we were ready to off-road. The riding was good, nothing too challenging, just easy riding to ease us back in after the long winter.</p>
<p>So as we left for the pub about 5.30pm the sun was shining and all was right with the world. The meal was awesome, and spirits were high, so we decided that camping would actually be a <em>really</em> good idea. I knew of a camp-site, nothing special, but this was camping right? We’d got tents and sleeping bags, what more did we need? We set off, Jayne leading the way, the last of the warm spring sun disappearing behind the rolling hills.</p>
<p>About half way to the site, a few spots of gentle rain began to appear on the windscreen. We wiped them away. The closer we got; the rougher the roads became, the rain was now slightly more than a a gentle smattering, and we were starting to think this was a bad idea.</p>
<p>We finally arrived at <a href="http://www.peakdistrict.org/pubs/access4all/byne.htm">Eric Byne camp-site</a> it was dark, pissing down, and bloody cold. After trudging up and down the hill several times, even the trip to the pub didn’t cheer us up much. All I can say is thank the Lord for Little Chef!</p>
