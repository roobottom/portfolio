  <h1>Article Output:</h1>
  <p>When I tried, and failed to write of review of 2014 I was a little disgusted at my poor memory. What <em>did</em> we do in January 2014? Honestly I have no idea, and aside from the obvious <em>recovered from the Christmas hangover</em> or <em>decided to loose some weight</em> January is a blur.</p>
<p>All these moments in our lives go by so quickly. I suppose this is one of the reasons that services like Facebook are so popular — they allow you to capture moments in your life and then give you a way to play it back at a later date. It’s exactly for this reason I started writing things down and publishing them here.</p>
<p>What better way to document 2015, the year we’re expecting our first child, than to take a photo every day. I have <a href="/gallery/365-2010">tried this before</a>, but gave up at day 16. I’m hopeful this time will be different and, inspired by <a href="http://mockingbirdcomic.com/comic-365/">Flix’s Project 365</a> rules, I’ve set myself some guidelines.</p>
<ul>
<li>Take at least one photo every day.</li>
<li>If you miss a day, don’t worry about it. Carry on the next day.</li>
<li>Write something about the photo. A paragraph or two will do.</li>
<li>Replacing photos is fine, as long as it’s just a better shot of what was there before.</li>
</ul>
<p>(figure set:jan)</p>
<p>My ultimate aim is to have a collection of memories from the year. Some will be mundane, most will be badly lit, but there may be a few we’ll print out and put on our walls. Treasured memories from what’s hopefully going to be a fun, scary and pooey nappy filled year.</p>
