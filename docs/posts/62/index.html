  <h1>Article Output:</h1>
  <p>We’d been hankering to see <strong>SOHN</strong> for a while, ever since I’d played his first album, <em>Tremors</em>, almost to death last summer. So when his second album, <em>Rennen</em>, was released earlier this year it meant an album tour was sure to follow.</p>
<p>So last week Katie and I braved a journey on Southern Rail up to the old Fridge Club (now The Electric) in Brixton: A club <em>slightly</em> too small to accommodate a sold-out <strong>SOHN</strong> crowed. Katie and I tucked ourselves in neatly at the back.</p>
<p>(figure set:SOHN)</p>
<p>The smoke machines belched with great gusto as <strong>SOHN</strong> took the stage. Seated behind a huge synth, he immediately launched into <em>Tremmors</em>, his powerful, pitch-perfect voice silencing even the most persistent talker.</p>
<p>He seemed to delight in giving each song some kind of embellishment: Whether that be an extended middle-eight or noodling around at the end, it was there in every song. It was mesmerising. I love live music, mainly for the sense of shared-experience. Everyone was swept along on the wave of <strong>SOHN</strong>’s synths, it put me in mind of a shared religious experience, everyone in enraptured ensemble.</p>
<p>I was also massively impressed by the beautiful set design: An arrangement of parallel strip-lights that changed colour and pulsed on and off in step with the music. They were the perfect focal point as <strong>SOHN</strong> plied his wares on stage.</p>

<p>Since a small person came to live in our house, our opportunity for evenings out has been severely limited. It’s a rare thing when the stars align to allow us to have a night away from home without <em>Roo</em>, so we have to get it right when we do. We defiantly got it right with <strong>SOHN</strong>. 10/10.</p>
