  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Hello, my name is Jon, and I’ve been designing and building things for the web <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010101*/roobottom.com">since 2001</a>. Yes, I’ve been at this quite a while now but don’t worry: I still sport a reassuringly wankerish beard and finely quaffed hair-do.</p>
<p>I live on England’s beautiful south coast with my wife and daughter.</p>
<h2>What I do</h2>
<p>I’m the Head of Design for Firefly Learning. I lead a team of UX, visual and communication designers. It’s my job to ensure they can succeed in their roles. I’m also a member of Firefly’s first team: The senior leadership crew with its hand of the tiller, navigating the company through choppy waters as we attempt to grow to 450 million users.</p>
<h2>What I value</h2>
<p>Having values is good. They help me decide what work is vital and what can I can ignore. My values are like the pruning sheers of my professional life.</p>
<p>(How can these needs be met? I.e., movement: being given the time to go for a run at lunchtime)</p>
<h3>Storytelling</h3>
<p>I believe in the power of stories and pictures to communicate complicated ideas.</p>
<h3>Code</h3>
<p>I believe in the importance of the logical, systems thinking that comes with learning how to program a computer</p>
<h3>Movement</h3>
<p>I believe that great work happens when both body and mind are fit and healthy</p>
<h3>Never being satisfied</h3>
<p>I believe in continually striving to better myself</p>
