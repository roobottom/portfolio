    <p>Hello, my name is Jon, and I‚Äôve been designing and building things for the web <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010101*/roobottom.com">since 2001</a>. Yes, I‚Äôve been at this quite a while now but don‚Äôt worry: I still sport a reassuringly wankerish beard and finely quaffed hair-do.</p>
<p>I live on England‚Äôs beautiful south coast with my wife and daughter.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-do">What I do</h2>
<p>I‚Äôm the Head of Design for Firefly Learning. I lead a team of UX, visual and communication designers. It‚Äôs my job to ensure they can succeed in their roles. I‚Äôm also a member of Firefly‚Äôs first team: The senior leadership crew with its hand of the tiller, navigating the company through choppy waters as we attempt to grow to 450 million users.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-value">What I value</h2>
<p>I‚Äôve thought long and hard about what I value at work. Acknowledging why I enjoy some roles and not others enable me to identify where I‚Äôll thrive and where I‚Äôll give my best. My values are the pruning sheers of my professional life.</p>
<h3 id="storytelling">Storytelling</h3>
<p>I believe in the persuasive power of carefully considered words and hardworking pictures for productive communication. I value time to collaboratively hone ideas through writing and drawing.</p>
<h3 id="code">Code</h3>
<p>I believe in the importance of logical, systematic thinking and how I can apply this beyond code into all areas of work. I value regular time to grow my skills as a programmer.</p>
<h3 id="building-things">Building things</h3>
<p>I find delight in the flow-state achieved when building things. I value roles that enable me to create as well as lead.</p>
<h3 id="automation">Automation</h3>
<p>I believe in creating systems to minimise grunt-work. I value the freedom to create these processes where they don‚Äôt exist.</p>
<p>For example: the (extremely fast) <a href="#">flat-file publishing system</a> I built to run this site.</p>
<h3 id="learning">Learning</h3>
<p>I believe that breakthrough ideas often come from outside my area of expertise. I value indulging my lifelong love of learning.</p>
<h3 id="movement">Movement</h3>
<p>I believe that great work happens when both body and mind are fit and healthy. I value time away from my desk to exercise.</p>
