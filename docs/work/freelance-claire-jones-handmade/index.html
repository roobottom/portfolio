    <p>Claire is an up-cycling genius who asked me to create and brand and e-commerce site that would reflect her quirky style and bring her handmade gifts to the masses.</p>
<p>Claire was keen to play an active role in the creation of her brand, and she had a pretty good idea of who she was and what she wanted the brand to say.</p>
<p>Early version of the logo were a little too on-the-nose for Claire‚Äôs tastes; too constrained and didn‚Äôt reflect the simple-yet-effective nature of her products.</p>
  <figure class="figure side-by-side">    <div class="figure__images">      <img src="/portfolio/images/claire-jones/early-logos.jpg" class="" />    </div>    <figcaption class="figure__caption">    Early versions of Claire's logo  </figcaption>  </figure>
<p>We spent time exploring what her products meant to her, and how her simple, bold style should be reflected in the brand. We also coined the tag-line <mark><em>handmade with love</em></mark> that reflected the care that Claire took when crafting each of her products by hand.</p>

  <figure class="figure figure--gallery side-by-side" data-gallery>      <div class="figure__images figure__images--gallery">    <div class="figure__image" data-width="1280" data-height="960" data-gallery-item >        <img src="/portfolio/images/claire-jones/cj-cards.jpg" class="" />      </div>    <div class="figure__image" data-width="800" data-height="600" data-gallery-item >        <img src="/portfolio/images/claire-jones/cj-stickers.jpg" class="" />      </div>        </div>      <figcaption class="figure__caption">    I created other collateral for Claire: Business cards and stickers, all printed using sustainable materials  </figcaption>  </figure>
<blockquote>
<p>Jon designed a fabulous brand, which I was able to use on all my merchandise as well as creating a stunning website. I had lots of comments on how attractive the website was. He also organised stickers, a self-inking stamp and business cards. Thank you Jon!</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Claire‚Äôs Website</h2>
<p>Claire had three goals for her website:</p>
<ol>
<li>To have a place where she could demonstrate her products and services to partners</li>
<li>To sell her products and effortlessly update her stock</li>
<li>To write engaging blog posts that would auto-syndicate to the Claire Jones page on Facebook</li>
</ol>
<p>To this end, I turned to <a href="https://shopify.com">Shopify</a>. It offers simple tempting giving me absolute control over the look and feel without having to worry about the complicated bits-n-bobs around taking payments and managing products.</p>
<p>Back in 2009, Shopify‚Äôs blog functionality was pretty basic. I believe it‚Äôs a different story now, but giving Claire all the features she wanted meant writing a bunch of custom scripts, that would do things like syndicate her content to Facebook.</p>
<p>The result was a place online that Claire could feel proud of. It gave her a home for her goods and services that would work hard for her, even when she slept.</p>
