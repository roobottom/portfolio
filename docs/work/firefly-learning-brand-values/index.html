    <p>We knew <em>what</em> we did, less clear was <em>why</em> we did it. I lead a project to uncover Firefly‚Äôs brand values.</p>
<hr />
<p>Over the last five years, Firefly Learning has enjoyed tremendous success; we have grown from fifty schools to over five hundred. We now have offices in London, Sydney and Singapore. Our dream to transform learning by empowering all students, teachers and parents is a lot closer today than it was when I joined in September 2011.</p>
<p>However, the schools we‚Äôve helped so far are just a drop in the ocean compared to the vast number of school-age children around the world. We want to improve learning for all students, not just some.</p>
<p>When we were small, it was easy for everyone internally to understand our mission; It passed by osmosis by daily contact with our founders, Simon and Joe. As we grow, we felt it was time to articulate our essence in a way that is inspirational and actionable for everyone in the business.</p>
<p>Our brand values have become the lens through which we view all of our decisions. They form the foundation of the <em>way</em> we talk about Firefly Learning in all of our communications. They are our north star; A guiding set of beliefs that ensure we are all pulling in the same direction.</p>
