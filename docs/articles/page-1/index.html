    <p><time>Wednesday, February 14th 2018</time></p>

    <p><time>Tuesday, May 2nd 2017</time></p>
    <p>I don‚Äôt think its hyperbole to say that there‚Äôs a revolution happening in the design of digital products.  Designers have long had the idea of designing interfaces from a kit of pre-built parts, but never really had the tools to do this effectively. Sketch is such a tool.</p>

    <h2><a href="/portfolio/articles/design-sprints-at-firefly">Design sprints at Firefly</a></h2>
    <p><time>Monday, February 13th 2017</time></p>
    <p>Sketching has always been essential part of what we do at Firefly. Thrashing out ideas with paper and pen is a great way of capturing early ideas quickly with the minimum of fuss. Together with user research, sketching is among the first steps we take whenever we‚Äôre designing a new feature.</p>
