    <h2><a href="/articles/5">Creating a pattern library in Sketch</a></h2>
    <p><time>Tuesday, May 2nd 2017</time></p>
    <p>I don’t think its hyperbole to say that there’s a revolution happening in the design of digital products.  Designers have long had the idea of designing interfaces from a kit of pre-built parts, but never really had the tools to do this effectively. Sketch is such a tool.</p>

    <h2><a href="/articles/4">Design sprints at Firefly</a></h2>
    <p><time>Monday, February 13th 2017</time></p>

Together with user research, sketching is among the first steps we take whenever we’re designing a new feature.</p>
