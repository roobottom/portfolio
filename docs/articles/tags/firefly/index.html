    <h2>Design sprints at Firefly</h2>
    <p>Sketching has always been essential part of what we do at Firefly. Thrashing out ideas with paper and pen is a great way of capturing early ideas quickly with the minimum of fuss. Together with user research, sketching is among the first steps we take whenever we‚Äôre designing a new feature.</p>
<p>We‚Äôre also constantly refining our processes, always on the lookout for more efficient ways to build better software that allow our users to perform the tasks they find most useful.</p>
<p>We‚Äôve recently started using some ideas from a methodology called <strong>Design Sprints</strong>. Although its still early days, I wanted to share our experience of (what I‚Äôm calling) Firefly-flavoured Design Sprints.</p>
<p>(figure set:squad)</p>
<h2>What is a design sprint?</h2>
<p>The design sprint was developed by Jake Knapp from <a href="http://www.gv.com/sprint/">Google Ventures</a>. In its full form, its a five day process for answering business questions through design. Its a way to fail early meaning you, <em>theoretically</em>, deliver something that works first time.</p>
<p>Implicit in the process is the requirement to gather opinions from all areas of the business, not just the design team. Typically you might involve those with customer contact, for example the support or client-experience teams. You may also invite an expert from finance and marketing as well as members from the tech and design teams.</p>
<p>A plan for the week might look like this:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Day</th><th>Outline</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>Monday</td><td>Understanding the challenge and decide what problem you‚Äôre trying to solve</td></tr>
<tr><td>Tuesday</td><td>A number of different sketching activities to fully explore potential solutions</td></tr>
<tr><td>Wednesday</td><td>The whole team presents and votes on solutions from Tuesday.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Thursday</td><td>Creating a prototype of a chosen solution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Friday</td><td>Testing your prototype with real users and gathering feedback.</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h2>What‚Äôs the benefit for Firefly?</h2>
<p>We‚Äôve been getting excited about Design Sprints for a while. The mantra of ‚Äúfail early‚Äù is especially useful as it helps us to stay agile in a fast-paced market place.</p>
<p>We‚Äôve always listened closely to what teachers, students and parents want, but understanding exactly what they‚Äôll find genuinely useful is rather more difficult.</p>
<p>A process like Design Sprints helps us get our ideas in-front of customers at the earliest possible opportunity, and find out if what we <em>think</em> they want is actually useful, without going through the long process of design, build and QA first.</p>
<h2>Our experience</h2>
<p>We already had a very well defined problem, namely how to give schools greater flexibility in their Firefly navigation. In the sprint we‚Äôd set out to design both the updated navigation and the administration interface that would allow site administrators to customise the menu.</p>
<p>I ran the day, as the ‚Äúfacilitator‚Äù. Viviana, our product manager, was the ‚Äúdecider‚Äù. The Communications squad (a cross-discipline team who would be building the feature) were our sketching team.</p>
<p>We used a number of the activities from the Design Sprints book, together with a mix of activities from elsewhere that we thought would enable us to solve this problem in a day.</p>
<h3>Jobs to be done</h3>
<p>Before the sprint, Viv created a list of <strong>jobs to be done</strong>. Based directly from feedback, these are a way to think about tasks that users want to achieve. They‚Äôre written in a way so as the focus is on the task rather than a particular technology or solution, an example of this might be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When organising the school‚Äôs Firefly pages, I want to be able to divide pages into highly visible sections, so I can make it easier to find content that is relevant for students, parents and teachers and show off the content we have.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Sketching</h3>
<p>We went through a number of sketching exercises, first creating quick low fidelity sketches to flesh-out some early ideas. Then we moved on to creating more detailed sketches that detailed a whole user journey.</p>
<p>(figure set:sketching)</p>
<h3>Arriving at a solution</h3>
<p>After each of the team had taken it in turns to present their sketch, we moved onto a round of <strong>heat mapping</strong>. Everyone was given a set of 10 sticky dots and we‚Äôre told to stick one or two next to features they particularly liked from the sketches. In this way, standout features were highlighted by clusters of dots.</p>
<p>(figure set:voting)</p>
<p>Viv then lead a round of Q&amp;A where we‚Äôd discuss the standout features. As the decider, she then made the call on which features would progress to design stage. I noted these down as a set of requirements.</p>
<p>Finally, we created a final set of sketches as a team (with one person designated as the ‚Äúscribe‚Äù) that combined all the features into a coherent user journey.</p>
<h2>What we learned</h2>
<p>This type of small, well-defined problem <em>is</em> solvable in a day. What we didn‚Äôt do is square the circle, i.e., test our solution with users. That‚Äôs a definite problem. We plan on creating interactive prototypes during the design stage which we‚Äôll test with teachers.</p>
<p>I predict this won‚Äôt turn-up too many surprises as we‚Äôve not deviated too far from an established pattern. But this is definitely worth thinking about earlier for more complex problems or brand-new features.</p>
<p>On a practical level we were also able to refine the ‚Äúshort-sprint‚Äù process for the next time: Chopping out the bits that didn‚Äôt yield anything useful and providing better explanations around the bits that confused people.</p>
<p>We would‚Äôve also liked to invite some guest experts from other areas of the business, we‚Äôll definitely do this next time.</p>
<h2>Where next?</h2>
<p>Finding a balance between the full methodology as set out in the book, and a process we can use many times in quick succession is tricky. Cherry-picking <em>is</em> something the book suggests: You can remove day five, and do testing as a separate process without the need for the whole team. However, we deconstructed the sprint to its bare-bones, and I‚Äôm not convinced we didn‚Äôt loose‚Ä¶ <em>something</em>.</p>
<p>But, Firefly-flavoured Design Sprints are definitely here to stay. We‚Äôve already booked-in longer sprints to help us solve slightly bigger problems, and allow us to include more of the methodology. We‚Äôll refine them over time, cherry-picking the bits that work best for us.</p>
<p>The culture of fail-early is one that we‚Äôre committed to. At the heart of this is getting features into the hands of clients as early as possible, listening to their feedback, and quickly delivering the next iteration. Design Sprints are just one way of doing this.</p>

    <h2>The road to Firefly 6, part 2</h2>
    <p>This is part two of a two part article all about building Firefly 6 and the lessons we learned along the way.</p>
<p>In <a href="/articles/59">part one</a> we took whistle stop tour of the year-and-a-half it took to design and build Firefly 6. This time I‚Äôm going to talk about some the front-end technology and practices we used to help us build more robust software.</p>
<h2>We built a pattern library</h2>
<p>Until Firefly 6, it was usual practice to build features one-by-one. There was little re-use of code, meaning if we found a bug with an element, then we‚Äôd have to fix it multiple times.</p>
<p>What we needed was a pattern library! In October we were joined for a few days by Anna Debenham who literally wrote the book on <a href="http://www.maban.co.uk/projects/front-end-style-guides/">front-end style guides</a> to help us catalogue Firefly‚Äôs user interface.</p>
<p>(figure set:anna)</p>
<p>We used this to build a ‚Äúsingle source of truth‚Äù library of interface elements. This means that Firefly is now essentially built from a kit of parts. If we need a button, we can just call one in from the library. Even better, if we find a bug with the button, we can fix it once, and its fixed everywhere. Much faster and a lot more robust.</p>
<p>I also have to mention <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniellehuntrods/">Danielle Huntrods</a>, a contractor who worked with us for almost a year, during which she built the majority of the of the pattern library. It was her brilliance that gave us such a solid foundation for the future.</p>
<p>We plan (at some point) to release a publicly accessible version of the pattern library. This is part of our ongoing commitment to openness and giving back to the web community. Hopefully others will find what we‚Äôve done useful.</p>
<h2>We flattened the cascade</h2>
<p>Cascading Style Sheets, or CSS, is the language that allows us to define the visual appearance of web pages. Firefly uses quite a lot of it.</p>
<p>CSS uses something called a ‚ÄúCascade‚Äù, meaning that elements can inherit their style from other elements that use the same HTML. For example:</p>
<pre><code>button {
    background-color: blue;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Means all <code>button</code> elements on the page would have a blue background.</p>
<p>However if you wanted to make one red, you can give it a name, and use that name in the CSS to override the background colour to red. Useful and straightforward enough.</p>
<p>However, The problem with this comes when you have thousands of elements. Sometimes, when you style one element, because of the way CSS cascades, you inadvertently style another element you didn‚Äôt mean to.</p>
<p>We solve this at Firefly by using a way of writing CSS called BEM, or Block Element Modifier. This allows us to effectively remove the cascade by using a naming system that guarantees that  you only ever style the specific element you meant to.</p>
<p>This is great for us at Firefly, as it means we ship far less styling bugs. And it makes it easy for us to fix those bugs that do slip through, knowing that we‚Äôre not going to accidentally  cause more bugs elsewhere.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/">read more about BEM here</a>, on the excellent CSS Tricks website.</p>
<h2>We became more Reactive</h2>
<p>Firefly makes heavy use of the other great language of the web: Javascript. This is the technology that allows us to manipulate the interface in real-time, without having to reload the page every time you take any action within Firefly.</p>
<p>To help us write better Javascript, we‚Äôve stared using a library called <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a>. React was developed by Facebook to solve some of the challenges they were facing when building their website.</p>
<p>To understand why this is good for Firefly, lets look at a practical example of a feature we introduced in Firefly 5: The Markbook.</p>
<p>The Markbook is a highly interactive screen with lots of different states. We use Javascript to manage these states. However, this is where things get complicated very quickly. The developer must remember to update <em>all</em> the states when the user interacts with <em>any</em> of the states.</p>
<p>For example, opening one popup will need to close any others. As you add more and more states, this compounds the problem. This is the source of many bugs, as developers can‚Äôt keep all these things in their heads all at once.</p>
<p>(figure set:markbook)</p>
<p>React manages states for you, by keeping its own internal copy of the page‚Äôs HTML, (what‚Äôs known as the Document Object Model, or DOM). It continually compares <em>its</em> model  to the real DOM that‚Äôs shown to the user, and updates it on the fly.</p>
<p>In this way, things like closing one popup when another is opening can be controlled by one simple rule, and React handles the rest. This is leads to less bugs and happier users.</p>
<p>We make use of React in the new Task Details screen, where teachers can mark student‚Äôs work in a variety of ways. This screen has hundreds of different states, all managed reliably by React.</p>
<h2>We simplified our themes offering</h2>
<p>This was perhaps the most controversial changes we made with made in Firefly 6. We did this to improve the user experience of the majority of users in Firefly, but quite understandably some schools were disgruntled when they discovered that we were retiring Columnist and Angular. We were also removed support for a number of custom themes we‚Äôd built for some of our long-standing clients.</p>
<h3>Fewer bugs</h3>
<p>Themes have always been the source of front-end bugs within Firefly. Each theme has its own HTML with which it ‚Äúwraps‚Äù standard Firefly elements (like resource page content, or the Markbook for example). It also has its own CSS with which it will restyle the standard Firefly elements.</p>
<p>This means that when we release new feature or updates existing ones, we also have to update the themes. The more themes, the more updates we have to do. Obviously, this model doesn‚Äôt scale well. So we‚Äôve reduced the number of themes we offer to ensure that when we release updates, we can ensure that all our schools have a great experience.</p>
<h3>Theme Variables</h3>
<p>What about theme customisation? Many schools want to inject their personality into the tools they use every day. In Firefly 5 we introduced <strong>Theme Variables</strong> to do just this. We improved them in Firefly 6 (more about that later), but its worth covering the basics:</p>
<p>Firefly uses a CSS pre-processor called <em><a href="http://lesscss.org/">Less</a></em>. This allows us to store colours as variables, and manipulate them programatically. For example, Melody has a variable called <code>@background-colour</code>, thats used in different places throughout the interface. <em>Less</em> allows you to use an array of <a href="http://lesscss.org/functions/#color-operations">colour operation functions</a> to do things like darken or lighten colours. This is particularly useful for creating a harmonious colour scheme.</p>
<p>We also use <em>Less</em> to check the relative contrast between two colours. For example, lets say we have a box, styled like this:</p>
<pre><code>.box {
    background-colour: @background-colour;
}
</code></pre>
<p>We‚Äôd want to check that any text that‚Äôs put inside that box is legible. We can do this with <em>Less</em> by checking the contrast of two alternative colours <em>against</em> a background colour, and using the one which is most legible, like so:</p>
<pre><code>.box {
    background-colour: @background-colour;
    color: contrast(@background-colour, black, white);
}
</code></pre>
<p>All of which means that, per school, we can override these core variables with school colours, and be assured that the interface will still look great, and all text will be legible.</p>
<h3>Better theme options</h3>
<p>We‚Äôve done a lot of work in Firefly 6 to improve and streamline the Theme Variables. Each theme now only requires a small set of colours. Every other colour used within the interface is based-off this core set.</p>
<p>We‚Äôve also removed a number of theme options that weren‚Äôt really adding much value for schools. For instance, lots of schools told us that they didn‚Äôt really care about things like background patterns, or changing fonts. We now use smart defaults instead.</p>
<p>We‚Äôve paved the way to style more of the interface based-off the schools‚Äô colour choices in the future, all in a way that will work with feature updates we make.</p>
<h2>Wrapping up</h2>
<p>I hope you‚Äôve found these couple of articles interesting. We like to be as open as possible about the way we build software. Hopefully this has given you an insight into the internal workings here at Firefly, and the things we‚Äôve done to ensure we‚Äôre delivering the absolute best product possible.</p>

    <h2>The road to Firefly 6, part 1</h2>
    <p>Recently, Robin, Viv and I had the honour of pushing the (literal) big red button that would enable our clients to upgrade to Firefly 6. Champaign corks were popped and pizza was enjoyed by the whole team before we, very quickly, very diligently, returned to work.</p>
<p>(figure set:A)</p>
<p>Now seems like a good point to pause, and look back on the past eighteen months and the changes we made to our team, technology and working practices that enabled us to release the biggest step-change in Firefly to date.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve broken this article into two parts: This first part starts with journey in time from the deep dark past of April 2015 right up to the present day. We learned a lot about <em>how</em> to build great software in this time, so I‚Äôll talk about that at the end.</p>
<p>In part two (spoiler alert) I‚Äôll talk about the changes we made to our technology stack and our design and front-end development teams.</p>
<h2>Spring/Summer 2015</h2>
<p>Back in April 2015 we knew <em>roughly</em> what teachers, students and parents wanted from the next version of Firefly. However, there was still lots of work to do to refine our ideas into a definite, focused list of features that would work for everyone.</p>
<p>As Head of Product, Viv ran a number of discovery workshops with teachers, students and parents from a large number of our schools. Armed with this research, our UX team was able to start sketching solutions from which we could create interactive product mock-ups. These were then tested with more users, refined, and tested again.</p>
<p>(figure set:testing)</p>
<p>We didn‚Äôt just limit this discovery phase to the start of the project, we continued to conduct user research at every stage. We‚Äôre lucky that our clients don‚Äôt mind acting as guinea pigs and let us test all our crazy new ideas on them. We also engaged an agency to connect with non-client teachers, students and parents, to ensure that the new features would work for everyone, not just those used to Firefly already.</p>
<h2>Autumn/Winter 2015</h2>
<p>While research and design were progressing nicely, thoughts turned to a busy conference season. With the Firefly Learning Conference just around the corner and Bett looming, we knew we needed something more tangible than interactive mock-ups to show people.</p>
<p>Bett, in particular, would be the first time clients and prospects alike could get hands-on with the new Firefly. We had to build a demo version of Firefly that would work well enough to give prospective clients a taste of what was to come in Firefly 6, that would also be robust enough to work with the WiFi in the ExCel centre.</p>
<p>In a sterling effort by all involved, we cut a demo-ready version of Firefly less than 24 hours before the start of the show. Despite there being a few bits of hidden sticky-tape and string holding everything together, we had an amazingly successful Bett. The demo stood up to anyting our stand visitors threw at it, and I think its fair to say that everyone was suitably wowed.</p>
<h2>Spring/Summer 2016</h2>
<p>At the Firefly Learning Conference in November we‚Äôd confidently told our clients that they could expect Firefly 6 in the summer term. By the spring it was apparent that we couldn‚Äôt meet this deadline and release a version of Firefly that was of sufficient quality. So we took the difficult decision to delay the release to the next logical point where schools would have a chance to install it in-between terms: Christmas.</p>
<p>In the summer we we‚Äôre able to release the new navigation, and because it was now in the hands of schools quickly iterate it based on feedback from a large group of users. As with all changes, it was met with a mixed reception, but the vast majority of users loved the changes we‚Äôd made.</p>
<h2>Autumn/Winter 2016</h2>
<p>We were now nearing the end of our development phase. A significant portion of both the web app and native iOS and Android apps had now been completed. We were on target for our completion date of 28th November, which would give us 2 weeks to do final testing before launch on 12th December.</p>
<p>Building software is hard; Building great software is very hard. So it was understandable that the final few weeks before our production deadline was filled with late nights and many take-outs in the office.</p>
<p>It is a testament to the diligent work of everyone involved that we brought this incredible new version in on time. Not just the team who built the software, but also the support, client experience, sales and marketing teams. They‚Äôre all responsible in equal part for Firefly 6.</p>
<p>(figure set:team,class:span-both)</p>
<h2>Please release me, let me go</h2>
<p>Even the most old school software companies release their software more often than every 18 months, so why did we take a year-and-a-half to release Firefly 6?</p>
<p>Well, the reality is that we were releasing, every two weeks in fact. We shipped <strong>35</strong> versions from <code>5.2.1</code> in April 2015 to <code>6.0.1</code> on 12th December 2016. These releases included a large number of bug fixes, and lots of new features and tweaks to existing features.</p>
<p>So why was 6 such a big release? Well, this was such a step change that there were several Epics that wouldn‚Äôt make sense in isolation. For example, the new <em>Set A Task</em> flow allows teachers to create rich tasks with far more flexibility than tasks they could create in Firefly 5. Releasing this without any ability for students to respond to these tasks, or teachers then to mark the response was simply unfeasible.</p>
<h2>Things we learned and changes we made</h2>
<p>We‚Äôve certainly have learned a thing or two along the way, not least that we need more development resource, but having just landing the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/15/firefly-takes-5-6m-series-a-for-its-learning-support-platform-for-schools/">largest Series A investment</a> in Education Technology in the UK, we‚Äôre certainly now in a position to do that.</p>
<p>It wouldn‚Äôt have been possible to build such complex software with a relatively small team without some smart ways of working. Over the last year-and-a-half we‚Äôve made some big changes to the way we work, these help us work faster and release less bugs.</p>
<h3>We established Epics, Squads and Guilds</h3>
<p>We spilt sets of features up into logic chunks. These, we call <strong>Epics</strong>. An Epic is a set of features that makes sense end-to-end. For example, the new task setting flow was a single Epic. This included all the backend logic, and user interface elements for teachers, parents and students.</p>
<p>Each Epic is owned by team called a <strong>Squad</strong>. A Squad is a self contained unit of UX‚Äôers, Designers, Developers and a manager. Everyone who‚Äôs needed to research, design, build, refine and manage workflow for that one Epic.</p>
<p>There are parts of the product that are relevant to more than one Squad. For example, the Pattern Library is used by all squads working on the Firefly web interface. To manage changes and updates to these areas we have <strong>Guilds</strong>. Typically a Guild will contain a representative from each Squad, and meet on an ad-hoc basis when changes are needed.</p>
<h3>We moved</h3>
<p>It would be remiss of me not to mention our new office. In October we moved from Lyric Square to the Aircraft Factory, in Hammersmith. We now have an amazing space that feels far more attuned to building brilliant software. We even have Joe‚Äôs old Raleigh Firefly bike (the inspiration for the name) in pride of place above his desk.</p>
<p>(figure set:office)</p>
<h3>We established the Nine Rules</h3>
<p>I think what we‚Äôve learned can be distilled into a set of principles that we‚Äôve refined throughout this project. These are <strong>Firefly‚Äôs Nine Rules:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Frequent tasks should be easy and occasional tasks achievable</strong>. Teachers are incredibly busy, don‚Äôt give them a vast array of options.</li>
<li><strong>Use smart defaults.</strong> We make good choices, so users don‚Äôt have to.</li>
<li><strong>Don‚Äôt make me think.</strong> Make the next action obvious and unambiguous. Reduce unnecessary choices.</li>
<li><strong>Beautiful by default.</strong> Teachers want to be proud of the things they create, so make this easy for them,</li>
<li><strong>Optimise.</strong> Firefly should be fast.</li>
<li><strong>Do less.</strong> Firefly should do a core set of things extremely well.</li>
<li><strong>Design for teaching, not content management.</strong> Firefly isn‚Äôt a content management system, its a learning tool.</li>
<li><strong>Right feature at the right moment.</strong> Too many options are confusing, be smart about when we expose a new feature.</li>
<li><strong>Firefly isn‚Äôt just used in school</strong> Users should be able to achieve their task, no matter their location.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Where next?</h3>
<p>Its an exciting time for Firefly. We‚Äôre expanding our team, and we‚Äôre brimming with ideas for the future. We‚Äôre working closely with a wide array of our clients to shape the next iteration of Firefly. There won‚Äôt be a large release for a while, but that‚Äôs exciting in itself, it means we‚Äôre going to work on smaller features that we can get into your hands quicker. I, for one, can‚Äôt wait to see what the next eighteen months brings.</p>
