    <h2>London</h2>
    <p>I’m lost for words as events unfold in London. Listening to the BBC news is surreal, it’s only just sinking in just what’s happened in our capital. Earlier Tony Blair confirmed that this looks like terrorist attacks timed to coincide with the G8 which starts in Scotland today.</p>
<p>One thing that stood out for me was the solidarity shown by other governments around the world. The French Prime Minister said that the Olympic defeat pales into the insignificance. Today, he said, we all stand as Londoners.</p>
<p>The Muslim council of Great Britain have condemned the attacks and called for calm. I think this is a very good point to remember, it would be a real tragedy for more innocent people to get hurt by unthinking individuals out for revenge. I just pray that no more people will be hurt, and all our thoughts are with the families who have lost loved ones this terrible morning.</p>
