    <h2>A camp weekend</h2>
    <p>There’s nothing quite like waking up at 4.30am on a very cold night, desperate for the loo, and then realising you’re in a tent on top of a foggy hill in the middle of Derbyshire.</p>
<p>It’d actually been a really nice sunny Good-Friday, perfect for mountain biking. So we set off: Four blokes, one van and Jayne (Chris’ sat-nav lady friend) - Gripped, sorted, we were ready to off-road. The riding was good, nothing too challenging, just easy riding to ease us back in after the long winter.</p>
<p>So as we left for the pub about 5.30pm the sun was shining and all was right with the world. The meal was awesome, and spirits were high, so we decided that camping would actually be a <em>really</em> good idea. I knew of a camp-site, nothing special, but this was camping right? We’d got tents and sleeping bags, what more did we need? We set off, Jayne leading the way, the last of the warm spring sun disappearing behind the rolling hills.</p>
<p>About half way to the site, a few spots of gentle rain began to appear on the windscreen. We wiped them away. The closer we got; the rougher the roads became, the rain was now slightly more than a a gentle smattering, and we were starting to think this was a bad idea.</p>
<p>We finally arrived at <a href="http://www.peakdistrict.org/pubs/access4all/byne.htm">Eric Byne camp-site</a> it was dark, pissing down, and bloody cold. After trudging up and down the hill several times, even the trip to the pub didn’t cheer us up much. All I can say is thank the Lord for Little Chef!</p>

    <h2>London</h2>
    <p>I’m lost for words as events unfold in London. Listening to the BBC news is surreal, it’s only just sinking in just what’s happened in our capital. Earlier Tony Blair confirmed that this looks like terrorist attacks timed to coincide with the G8 which starts in Scotland today.</p>
<p>One thing that stood out for me was the solidarity shown by other governments around the world. The French Prime Minister said that the Olympic defeat pales into the insignificance. Today, he said, we all stand as Londoners.</p>
<p>The Muslim council of Great Britain have condemned the attacks and called for calm. I think this is a very good point to remember, it would be a real tragedy for more innocent people to get hurt by unthinking individuals out for revenge. I just pray that no more people will be hurt, and all our thoughts are with the families who have lost loved ones this terrible morning.</p>

    <h2>The Rain in Spain</h2>
    <p>(figure set:a)</p>
<p>Isn’t it funny how you meet new people? Let’s say for example that you commented on someones <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a> photos, and six months later you fly out to Spain to visit them. Well, funnily enough (cue sincere laughter) that’s exactly what happened to me.</p>
<p>Madrid was awesome, and a good time was had by all. We saw castles, bars, mountains, bars, shops, bars, trains, planes and automobiles. Oh, and bars. But all this got me thinking up until I’d actually spent more than one afternoon with Liz I’d been feeling a little… seedy about meeting someone over the internet. Maybe that’s not the right word, but my limited vocabulary doesn’t allow me to be any more descriptive.</p>
<p>I’m sure you know what I mean, ‘meeting’ people via the internet does have a certain stigma attached to it. I’m very happy to say in this case my new friend (who I’ve firmly move up from ‘flickr friend’ status) turned out to be awesome.</p>
