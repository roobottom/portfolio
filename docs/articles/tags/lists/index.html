    <h2>Back to the old school</h2>
    <p>It’s been a while since my last post so I better make this a good-un (well, relatively speaking). It being the season of University mates birthday’s (including mine - which is today by the way, just in case you wanted to send me that spare Ferrari you don’t use any more), I headed up to Huddersfield.</p>
<p>The night started out in traditional style with pizza-pie and vodka then continued the trend with a trip to Session, Vox, Sharkeys and then I’m sure there was more, but I know we did end up in the new noodle bar, which was nice (despite me voting for Lazeez, again). It was awesome to see the lads again, and kinda made me pine for the good old days of finishing work at 4.30 in the afternoon and getting home at 3 in the morning having only stopped off for a “quick pint” in Vox.</p>
<p>But I guess you get older and move on… back to Brownhills… <em>Damn</em>.</p>
<p>The rest of the weekend consisted of sitting around at Riks watching movies and eating yet more junk food. What could be better?</p>

    <h2>Top 10</h2>
    <p>Ever since our earliest days the Human race has been plagued by questions: Who are we? Why are we here? I’ve have spent the last few weeks pondering such a question. A question that has taxed my (some say feeble) brain to it’s very limits. I’ve pondered, I’ve considered, I’ve wept in despair, and I let out a few little farts of frustration wondering just what are my 10 greatest albums of all time?</p>
<p>I’ve compiled this list as an answer, I just hope I can get what those shrinks call closure on this issue. How can I decide this? I was thinking maybe <em>Jazz</em> by Queen, or <em>Baby O’Riley</em> by The Who, but what about Bowie? Nah, picking number 1 is just too difficult.</p>
