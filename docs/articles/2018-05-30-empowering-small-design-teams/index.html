    <p>How do you reward growth when your design team isn’t large enough to offer promotion? Recently, we’ve been experimenting with other ways to recognise the achievements of the UI Designers on our team.</p>
<p>As you progress though your design career, you may expect to eventually move through the ranks and become a manager. But what happens when the your team isn’t big enough to have this type of structure, or you’re simply not interested in managing people?</p>
<p>We’ve been encountering both these problems and have therefore been striving to recognise seniority in other ways.</p>
<h2 id="design-leads-and-owners">Design leads and owners</h2>
<p>In addition to the core role of UI Designer, we’ve introduced a group of new add-on roles to recognise seniority. These roles are assigned to the designer who has the most experience in an area. One person can assume multiple roles at once.</p>
<h3 id="themes-lead">Themes Lead</h3>
<p>The role of the Themes Lead is to ensure our four themes (Melody, Folio, Storybook and Nautilus) and our Help Site theme are delightful to use and offer a consistent, high-quality user experience while maintaining their distinctive character.</p>
<h3 id="product-copy-lead">Product Copy Lead</h3>
<p>The role of the Product Copy Lead is to make the labelling and instructions within Firefly the product as clear as possible so users know what choices are available.</p>
<h3 id="web-design-system-owner">Web Design System Owner</h3>
<p>The role of the Web Design System Owner is to be responsible for the development of a pattern library and style guide that are practical tools for designing and documenting web UI within Firefly. This person is responsible for defining the vision and best practice for the system.</p>
<h3 id="mobile-design-systems-owner">Mobile Design Systems Owner</h3>
<p>The role of the Mobile Design Systems Owner is to be responsible for the development of  pattern libraries and style guides for iOS and Android that are practical tools for designing and documenting mobile UI for Firefly. This person is responsible for defining the vision and best practice for these systems.</p>
<h3 id="motion-design-lead">Motion Design Lead</h3>
<p>The role of the Motion Design Lead is to own the way in which motion is used throughout Firefly on the web and mobile apps and to provide useable guidelines and tools for UI designers and developers.</p>
<h3 id="product-design-evangelist">Product Design Evangelist</h3>
<p>The role of the Product Design Evangelist is to lead our efforts to socialise design thinking internally and externally. This includes helping others understand how design helps us succeed, why design thinking is important and how everyone can use design thinking in their role.</p>
